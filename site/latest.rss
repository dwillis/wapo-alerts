      <title>Hunter Biden convicted of lying during gun purchase, after trial that focused on his drug addiction</title>
      <description>President Biden’s son Hunter was accused of lying when he claimed on a federal gun-purchasing form that he was not using or addicted to illegal drugs, and of illegally possessing a Colt revolver while on drugs. His attorneys said he completed a stint in rehab shortly before buying the gun in October 2018 and was drug-free for the 11 days it was in his possession.</description>

      <title>It was a beautiful day in this coastal town. Watch what happened when the water started to rise.</title>
      <description>The Washington Post installed cameras along the main road of one North Carolina town to document the many ways rising seas exacerbate high-tide flooding. Higher oceans are compromising stormwater infrastructure, overtopping shorelines, elevating groundwater and combining with rain to make flooding more persistent and insidious over time.</description>

      <title>‘Gaslit by doctors,’ some patients are turning to a shadow system of at-home tests</title>
      <description>A new world of DIY testing is allowing patients to bypass the doctor’s office and take medical tests on their own. The growth is fueled by a distrust of Big Medicine and confidence in home-testing born from the coronavirus pandemic. But the boom angers some doctors, who argue that circumventing their offices can lead to questionable remedies, misdiagnosis or delayed medical care.</description>

      <description>Civil rights chroniclers credit the Rev. Lawson, a Methodist minister, with playing a leading role in the opening of restaurants, movie theaters, city buses, public restrooms and municipal swimming pools in Nashville, one of the first major Southern cities to desegregate public accommodations.

      <title>Home insurance was once a ‘must.’ Now more homeowners are going without.</title>
      <description>Experts say the trend in forgoing home insurance is driven by the growing impact of climate change — which has forced insurers to make larger and larger payouts — and skyrocketing housing prices. As the cost of insurance rises, more Americans have decided to expose themselves to risk rather than pay for it.</description>

      <title>Far right projected to make big gains in European Parliament; pending loss prompts France’s Macron to call legislative elections</title>
      <description>Early forecasts in the European Parliament elections show voters punishing ruling centrists and boosting nationalist parties that have made populist economic appeals and taken hard-right positions on immigration. After polls showed the far-right National Rally trouncing French President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist coalition, he dissolved the national parliament and set the first round of elections for June 30.</description>
