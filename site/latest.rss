      <title>Judge temporarily blocks California National Guard members from deploying to Oregon</title>
      <description>U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut said the government appeared to be directly defying her previous order by instead sending members of California’s Guard.

Immergut, a Trump appointee confirmed to the bench in 2019, issued a new, broader order Sunday to prohibit the administration from sending any state’s National Guard troops under federal control to Oregon.</description>
