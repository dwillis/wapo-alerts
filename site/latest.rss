      <title>Supreme Court limits nationwide orders blocking Trump’s birthright citizenship ban</title>
      <description>The 6-3 ruling will impact decisions by lower-court judges to block President Donald Trump’s ban on birthright citizenship and probably other Trump administration initiatives.

      <title>Bill Moyers dies at 91. The acclaimed journalist won renown for bringing discussion of ideas — both timely and timeless — to TV.</title>
      <description>He was White House press secretary under Lyndon B. Johnson and Newsday publisher before beginning a television career that would bring him more than 30 Emmy Awards, including one for lifetime achievement. He was mainly associated with PBS, and although he frequently explored societal ills, he was happier speaking with poets and philosophers than he was with pollsters or politicians.</description>

      <title>RFK Jr. appointees vote to effectively remove a flu shot preservative, advancing a priority of anti-vaccine activists</title>
      <description>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — overhauled by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — voted Thursday to stop recommending flu shots containing the preservative thimerosal, which research has shown is safe. Most flu shots are thimerosal-free, but public health experts said the move could make shots more expensive and harder to receive. Many also expressed concern that anti-vaccine rhetoric is becoming official government guidance.</description>

      <description>“Tonight was not our night,” the former governor told supporters. He said of Mamdani: “Tonight is his night. He deserved it.

Final results in the ranked-choice voting primary are expected to come next week. The Democratic nominee is expected to begin as a favorite in the general election in a heavily blue city.</description>

      <description>Mamdani, who would be New York’s first Muslim mayor, didn’t break the 50 percent mark in the first round of counting, the Associated Press reported. But it was still a good performance for the 33-year-old democratic socialist state assemblyman, a relative newcomer who was facing off with a former governor with copious campaign cash and prominent endorsements. Under the city’s ranked choice system, officials will now drop the candidate who finished last and continue counting votes until a candidate bests 50 percent.</description>
