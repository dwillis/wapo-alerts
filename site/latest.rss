      <title>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth calls Ukraine’s peace goals ‘unrealistic’ in meeting with allies</title>
      <description>Hegseth on Wednesday called Ukraine’s desire to recover all of the territory it has lost to Russia since 2014 an “unrealistic objective” while pledging that the Trump administration will pursue peace negotiations to end war between the two nations. Any deal, Hegseth added, must come with “robust security guarantees,” international oversight of the boundary between Russian and Ukrainian forces, and no NATO membership for Ukraine — something that would require other countries to defend Ukrainian territory in any future conflict.</description>

      <title>Trump announces release of Marc Fogel, an American imprisoned in Russia, as part of deal with Kremlin</title>
      <description>As a result of the deal, Fogel has been released and is returning to the United States, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz said in a statement. Fogel was detained by Russian officials in August 2021 and charged with smuggling into the country a small amount of medical marijuana, which was prescribed in the United States for back pain but is banned in Russia. Waltz called the deal with Russia an “exchange” but provided no information on what the United States offered in return. It was negotiated by President Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, he said.</description>

      <title>Israel will end Gaza ceasefire if Hamas does not return hostages Saturday, Netanyahu says</title>
      <description>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an address Tuesday that Israel would "gather forces inside and around the Gaza Strip" in preparation to resume war if hostages held by Hamas are not returned Saturday.

Hamas said Monday it would delay the release over accusations of Israeli ceasefire violations. Netanyahu's remarks come after President Donald Trump said "all hell is going to break out" if hostages are not released.</description>
