      <description>The personal data of more than 200 former congressional staffers and others was made public Tuesday in newly unredacted documents related to the assassination of John F.

      <title>Trump administration plans for U.S. military to hold migrants who cross border illegally — a potential major shift in enforcement</title>
      <description>The administration is evaluating a proposal for the Pentagon to take control of a buffer zone along the southern border and empower the active-duty troops deployed there to temporarily hold migrants who cross into the United States illegally, according to five U.S. officials familiar with the deliberations. If enacted, the move would mark a major shift, giving the military its most direct role yet in President Donald Trump’s expanding enforcement mission.</description>

      <description>The chief justice of the United States took issue with President Donald Trump’s calls to impeach a lower-court judge who blocked the use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations.

“For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,” Roberts said in a statement in response to media inquiries. “The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”</description>
