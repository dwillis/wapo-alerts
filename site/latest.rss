But Republicans and some who served with the Minnesota governor have decried his decision to retire before their National Guard unit went to war and his characterization of aspects of his time in uniform.</description>

      <title>Nancy Pelosi says she joined the effort to urge Biden to end reelection bid because his campaign had ‘no path to victory’</title>
      <description>In her most extensive remarks yet about the the political earthquake of the past few weeks, the former House speaker said she was concerned President Joe Biden staying in the race would inevitably lead to the reelection of Donald Trump. Pelosi, who carries tremendous clout on Capitol Hill and in the Democratic Party, also said that while she did not make any phone calls seeking Biden’s ouster, “hundreds” of people who wanted to see that outcome called her.</description>

      <title>Trump took a private flight with Project 2025’s leader in 2022. He recently claimed he had ‘no idea who is in charge of it.’</title>
      <description>Former president Donald Trump shared a 45-minute chartered flight with Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts in April 2022, according to people familiar with the trip, plane-tracking data and a photograph from the plane. Trump was traveling to speak at a Heritage Foundation conference, where he said, “They’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do.”

The flight and Trump’s comments from the time undercut the former president’s recent efforts to distance himself from Project 2025 once Democrats turned some of its most controversial proposals into a frequent campaign attack.</description>
