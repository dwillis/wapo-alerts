      <title>Trump allies threaten Deloitte contracts after employee shares JD Vance chats</title>
      <description>Republicans backing Donald Trump are threatening Deloitte, a consulting firm that is one of the federal government’s largest business partners, with the loss of billions of dollars in contracts because an employee shared messages from 2020 in which Vance, now the GOP vice-presidential nominee, criticized the then-president’s record. 

Ethics experts said the episode is a potentially ominous preview of how a second Trump administration might use the enormous power the federal government wields over private industry to punish political acts by individual workers.</description>
