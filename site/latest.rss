      <description>In a Friday night memo, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin withdrew the agreements with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two others charged in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that would have allowed them to avoid the death penalty.

      <title>Day 7 highlights from Paris Olympics: Richardson back on track; Marchand a four-time gold medalist; an unlikely U.S. medal</title>
      <description>Sha’Carri Richardson easily won her heat in the 100 meters and is a favorite to take gold in that event three years after being suspended for the Tokyo Games. In the pool, Leon Marchand, the hometown hero, cruised to his fourth gold of these Games in the 200-meter individual medley, while American star Caeleb Dressel failed to advance to Saturday's 100-meter butterfly final and Regan Smith grabbed her second silver of the week for the United States. And back at the track, Grant Fisher used a strong finishing kick to capture the first U.S. medal in the men's 10,000 since Galen Rupp’s silver in 2012 — and only the second since 1964.</description>

      <title>Harris formally secures Democratic nomination, officially becoming the first woman of color to lead a presidential ticket</title>

Democratic leaders decided months ago, when Biden was still expected to be the nominee, to use a virtual vote to finalize the nomination, rather than waiting for the party’s convention in Chicago from Aug. 19-22.</description>

      <title>U.S. says Maduro lost Venezuelan presidential election and calls for negotiations to transition away from socialist government</title>
      <description>Secretary of State Antony Blinken said “overwhelming evidence” makes it “clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people” that opposition candidate Edmundo González won the election Sunday. President Nicolás Maduro claims that he won the vote. Independent exit polling and, the opposition says, the government’s own records indicate that González won twice as many as votes as Maduro. The authoritarian socialist has refused to release those records as required by Venezuelan law.</description>

      <description>Former president Donald Trump said he had been aware of Vice President Harris’s Indian heritage but didn’t know she was Black “until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black.”

Trump claimed Harris used to only promote her Indian heritage — even though, as a moderator pointed out, she was part of a historically Black sorority and embraced her Black identity in many ways. “And now she wants to be known as Black,” Trump said during a very combative question-and-answer session at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago.</description>

      <description>Facing his country’s demographic decline and a war in Ukraine that is killing and wounding many men, the Russian president is urging women to adopt traditional roles and serve the nation by giving birth young and often, and by raising their children to be patriots.

      <title>Senate passes landmark bills to protect kids online, raising pressure on House</title>
      <description>The pair of bills — the Kids Online Safety Act, or KOSA, and the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, referred to as COPPA 2.0 — would force digital platforms to take “reasonable” steps to prevent harms to children such as bullying, drug addiction and sexual exploitation, and would broaden existing federal privacy protections to include kids and teens 16 years old and younger. Proponents of the measures hope Senate passage will amplify calls for the package to be taken up in the House, where the bills have garnered bipartisan support but negotiations publicly unraveled last month amid infighting between House Republican leaders.</description>
