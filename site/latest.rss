      <title>Biden commutes the death sentences of most federal inmates before Trump takes office</title>
      <description>The president changed the sentences of 37 of the 40 prisoners on death row to life without parole, saying he was convinced “that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level.” The incoming Trump administration is widely expected to restart executions. Three others, involved in cases of “terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder,” still face execution.</description>

      <title>The District now has a realistic option for Commanders’ stadium at the old RFK site after political Hail Mary</title>
      <description>In a stunning, last-second twist, Congress passed federal legislation early Saturday to allow D.C. to redevelop the RFK Stadium site and potentially bring the Washington Commanders back to the city.

      <title>House GOP leadership is set to propose a third funding plan today in hopes of averting a government shutdown. Follow our coverage.</title>
      <description>After the failure of a Trump-backed plan, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) was considering offering two options hours before a midnight deadline. One would extend the current fiscal levels until mid-March and a farm bill for one year, and includes $110 billion for natural disasters. It would not include Trump’s demand for raising the debt ceiling. Another plan floated is just a clean extension, known as a continuing resolution or CR, for several weeks into the new year.</description>
