      <title>This middle school’s battle against cellphones yielded surprising results</title>
      <description>Illing Middle School in Manchester, Conn., navigated objections from students and some parents to lock up cellphones in a bid to improve focus and reduce social media-fueled conflicts. What unfolded reflects a broader struggle underway in education as some administrators turn to increasingly drastic measures to limit the reach of a technology that is both ubiquitous and endlessly distracting.</description>

      <title>House passes divisive antisemitism bill as Republicans seek to crack down on campus protests over Gaza war</title>
      <description>Critics of the Antisemitism Awareness Act, which has some Democratic support, call the legislation an effort to silence opinions of Israel and an affront to the First Amendment. It’s unclear what the bill’s prospects are in the Democratic-controlled Senate.</description>

      <title>GOP-led Arizona Senate votes to repeal Civil War-era abortion ban. The Democratic governor is expected to sign it into law.</title>
      <description>The state’s highest court revived the ban on nearly all abortions in early April and it was set to take effect in June. The repeal is expected to be signed into law by Gov. Katie Hobbs in the coming days, but the state attorney general’s office said the repeal would not take effect until 90 days after the legislature adjourns for the summer. So, barring successful court challenges, the 1864 ban could take effect for a short time in the state.</description>

      <title>A landmark study scared women away from menopause hormone treatments. A 20-year follow-up has found fears were largely overblown.</title>
      <description>A new analysis published in JAMA found that for many younger menopausal women — typically those under 60 — the benefits of the drugs probably outweigh the risks for the short-term treatment of menopause symptoms. The analysis shows that younger women starting menopause and experiencing symptoms can take hormone treatments for several years with a lower likelihood of adverse effects.</description>

      <title>Federal judges strike down Louisiana's new congressional map, saying second majority Black district is unconstitutional</title>
      <description>The panel ruled Tuesday that a newly redrawn congressional map, which added a second majority Black district, violated the Equal Protection Clause and blocked the state from using the map in upcoming elections. The Louisiana legislature approved the new map in January after a federal court found that the existing map probably illegally diminished Black voting power.</description>

      <title>DEA plans to reclassify marijuana as a lower-risk drug, officials say — a major move that would ease access nationwide</title>
      <description>The move by the Drug Enforcement Administration, first reported by the Associated Press, must receive approval from the White House Office of Management and Budget. Such a decision would not legalize marijuana at the federal level but could broaden access for medicinal use and boost the cannabis industry in states where the drug is legal.</description>
