      <title>Supreme Court deadlocks, blocking creation of nation’s first public religious charter school</title>
      <description>With only eight justices voting, the Supreme Court’s 4-4 tie leaves in place an Oklahoma state Supreme Court decision that blocked the creation of the Catholic school and said it would be unconstitutional. A ruling for St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School would have for the first time allowed direct and complete taxpayer funding to establish a faith-based school, allowing government sponsorship of a curriculum that calls for students to adhere to Catholic beliefs and the church’s religious mission.</description>
