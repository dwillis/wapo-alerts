      <title>Women are dropping birth control amid a misinformation explosion driven by social media influencers and conservative commentators</title>
      <description>Social media algorithms feed young women a stream of videos reinforcing messages divorced from scientific evidence.

      <title>‘Very, very troubling’: Legal experts flummoxed by latest order from judge overseeing Trump classified documents case</title>
      <description>U.S. District Judge Aileen M. Cannon, who is overseeing Donald Trump’s pending trial on charges that he mishandled classified documents, has ordered defense lawyers and prosecutors to outline  proposed jury instructions based on two scenarios — each of which badly misstates the law and facts of the case, according to legal experts.
“In my 30 years as a trial judge, I have never seen an order like this,” said Jeremy Fogel, who served on the federal bench in California and now runs the Berkeley Judicial Institute.</description>

      <title>Senate hopeful Larry Hogan (R) has double-digit lead on Democrats in deep-blue Maryland, poll finds, with control of chamber in play</title>
      <description>A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll finds the former governor ahead of potential Democratic rivals, who face each other for the open seat on May 14. In that wide-open primary contest, the poll found Rep. David Trone with a slight lead over Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrook, with 39 percent of primary voters undecided. While Hogan leads now, Maryland voters said by a 20-point margin they prefer Democratic control of the Senate, a position Democrats plan to exploit to weaken Hogan's popularity.</description>
