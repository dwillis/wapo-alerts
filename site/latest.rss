      <title>A mysterious condition is striking young, highly trained athletes</title>
      <description>First described more than 150 years ago, POTS has proliferated since the coronavirus pandemic. The syndrome tends to strike suddenly, leaving previously healthy people unable to function, with no clear cause. In recent years, doctors have noticed a curious and disproportionate subset of patients: female athletes at peak fitness.</description>

      <title>Robert MacNeil dies at 93. The broadcast journalist helped start what is now ‘PBS NewsHour.’</title>
      <description>MacNeil and co-anchor Jim Lehrer formed one of television journalism’s most successful and enduring partnerships in 1975, when they launched what became “The PBS NewsHour.” For two decades, MacNeil served as an urbane, evenhanded co-anchor, maintaining a reputation for sober, straightforward reporting and analysis.</description>

      <title>U.S. hikes cost of oil drilling on federal lands for first time in decades, a bid to generate more money for taxpayers</title>
      <description>The Interior Department rule represents the first comprehensive update to the federal oil and gas leasing program in more than 30 years. It will force oil companies to pay at least 10 times more to drill on U.S. lands — $150,000 up from $10,000 — plus higher royalties. The rule also aims to prevent taxpayers from footing the bill for cleanup of abandoned oil and gas wells.</description>

      <title>Stormy Daniels’s other court battle: A multimillion-dollar horse feud</title>
      <description>As Stormy Daniels prepares to take center stage in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial, she’s also embroiled in a far less high-profile legal battle in Texas: a clash in the horse world that has ensnared some of the top officials in the rarefied world of competitive English riding. That bitter dispute shows the same dynamics that have defined Daniels’s existence on the national stage — questions about her credibility, the adulation of supporters who say she’s standing up for the truth and a large amount of money at stake.</description>

      <title>A narco revolt takes a once-peaceful nation to the brink</title>
      <description>Ecuador’s young president declared war on the country’s powerful drug gangs after they sparked a wave of violence, including killings, kidnappings and car bombs. The Post has reconstructed the day Ecuador nearly collapsed when organized-crime groups, which have vastly expanded their influence across Latin America, launched attacks on the police, seized a TV station and rioted in prisons.</description>

      <description>The nation’s view of Simpson's 1995 acquittal in the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and a friend, Ronald Goldman, largely fell along racial lines, though time has bridged some of the gap.</description>

      <title>Women in states with bans often take abortion pills alone and afraid. They share their experiences.</title>
      <description>Overwhelming evidence shows that taking abortion pills is safe and effective. But as more women in states where abortion is illegal choose to end their pregnancies on their own, without directly interacting with a medical professional, they are thrust into a largely ad hoc, unregulated system of online and grass-roots abortion pill distributors. The experience can be confusing, scary and, at times, deeply traumatic.</description>

      <description>Federal prosecutors announced Thursday that they have charged the interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, with bank fraud, alleging he impersonated the Los Angeles Dodgers star to access his bank accounts and pay off illegal gambling debts, a major turn in a scandal that rocked baseball. Ohtani “is a victim,” prosecutors said.</description>

      <description>President Biden plans to enlarge the boundaries of two national monuments near Los Angeles and the Bay Area in the coming weeks, aiming to bolster his conservation record and increase access to nature for disadvantaged communities, according to two people briefed on the matter. Biden is expected to sign proclamations expanding the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument and the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument. The exact timing has not been finalized.</description>

      <title>Longest-serving liberal on Wisconsin Supreme Court won’t run again, potentially upending swing-state court after $50 million race</title>
      <description>Justice Ann Walsh Bradley’s retirement gives conservatives their last chance in the coming years to win a majority after losing last year’s race, the most expensive judicial contest in U.S. history. The court with 4-3 votes upheld Joe Biden’s win and ended a GOP gerrymander. It could soon decide whether abortion remains legal.</description>

      <title>O.J. Simpson dies at 76. His murder trial led the former NFL star to become a symbol of domestic violence and racial division.</title>
      <description>Simpson died of cancer on Wednesday, his family announced on X. In a trial that riveted the nation, Simpson was found not guilty in 1995 of murdering his ex-wife and her friend, though he was later found liable in a civil judgment. He spent years in jail on unrelated charges — a stunning downfall for a man who had risen from a San Francisco slum to become one of the greatest running backs in football history, an actor in more than 20 movies, a corporate pitchman and a TV sports commentator.</description>

      <description>A special grand jury report alleged that the boy was not supposed to be attending the school after an incident in which he choked a teacher, but lapses by administrators allowed him back on campus.

      <title>What we know about China’s alleged election interference in Canada as Trudeau testifies in public inquiry</title>
      <description>China sought to “clandestinely and deceptively” influence Canada’s federal elections in 2019 and 2021 with the aim of electing candidates that could further — or at least not oppose — Beijing’s strategic interests, according to Canadian intelligence reports introduced as evidence in a public inquiry.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had long resisted calls to launch a public inquiry into claims that China interfered in Canada’s elections and has defended his government’s response to the threat of foreign interference. The Canadian leader, who is testifying before the commission today, has said there’s no evidence the results of the elections were compromised.</description>

But he has made significant inroads in convincing Republicans that his lies are the truth. That applies to election integrity especially — the basis of Trump’s “big lie.”</description>
