      <title>Ruth Westheimer dies at 96. The sex therapist was known to millions as ‘Dr. Ruth.’</title>
      <description>Westheimer was over 50 when she debuted on New York radio in the 1980s to explain, in straightforward fashion, the ways of making love. A child survivor of the Holocaust, she once said that “because I was not killed by the Nazis — because I survived — I had an obligation to make a dent in the world.” Her mix of candor and can-do cheer made her a popular guest on late-night talk shows.</description>

      <title>OpenAI rushed through safety tests, undermining its White House AI pledge</title>
      <description>The start-up promised the White House it would rigorously safety-test new versions of its tech to make sure it wouldn’t inflict damage. But this spring, some members of OpenAI’s safety team felt pressured to speed through a new testing protocol, designed to prevent the technology from causing catastrophic harm, to meet a May launch date set by company leaders, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. The previously unreported incident sheds light on the changing culture at OpenAI, where company leaders including CEO Sam Altman have been accused of prioritizing commercial interests over public safety — a stark departure from the company’s roots as an altruistic nonprofit.</description>

      <title>Donald Trump seeks dismissal of N.Y. charges and conviction, citing Supreme Court’s sweeping ruling on presidential immunity</title>
      <description>Trump is seeking to toss out the guilty verdict after the Supreme Court ruled that a president’s official conduct cannot be used as evidence against him. In a court filing, Trump’s lawyers said Trump’s tweets and testimony from two White House aides should not have been allowed at his New York hush money trial, where he was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records in an attempt to impact the 2016 election.</description>

The plan, which would require rest breaks for employees when the heat index tops 90 degrees, faces industry opposition, but it could be transformative for workers — especially in the South.</description>

      <title>Shelley Duvall dies at 75. The versatile actress became a face of 1970s film and was chased by Jack Nicholson in ‘The Shining.’</title>
      <description>Duvall was among the most distinctive actresses to emerge out of the so-called New Hollywood era of the late 1960s and ’70s, when directors were making personal, idiosyncratic films that ran counter to the old studio mold. Discovered by director Robert Altman at a party in Houston, she appeared in many of his acclaimed ensemble-driven movies, including “Brewster McCloud,” “McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller” and “Nashville.”</description>
