      <title>Scientists discover microplastics are building up in our brains — with potentially dangerous effects for human health</title>
      <description>New research published Monday in Nature Medicine shows that microplastics are breaking the blood-brain barrier — and building up in the human body.

The scientists also found that the brains of patients with dementia had significantly more microplastics than healthy ones.</description>
