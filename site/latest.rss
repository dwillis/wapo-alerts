      <title>Latest late-night shakeup confirms that media companies must punish Trump critics if they want deals approved, our columnist writes</title>
      <description>ABC said it was pulling “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” off the air, following a similar announcement from Nexstar, the largest owner of television stations in the United States. The move was ostensibly in response to a remark Kimmel made Monday night, which Nexstar and Sinclair, its biggest competitor, have characterized as so beyond the pale that the late-night comic’s show could not be permitted to air.</description>
