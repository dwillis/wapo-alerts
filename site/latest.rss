      <title>Hegseth tries to distance himself from boat strike fallout as White House emphasizes admiral’s role</title>
      <description>The Washington Post reported exclusively Friday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a spoken order to kill the entire crew of a vessel thought to be ferrying narcotics in the Caribbean Sea. When two survivors were detected, the military commander overseeing the operation, Adm. Frank M. Bradley, directed another strike to comply with Hegseth’s order that no one be left alive, people with direct knowledge of the matter told The Post.</description>

      <title>The alleged National Guard shooter once served in an elite CIA-backed unit. But his life unraveled as a refugee in the U.S.</title>
      <description>The course of Rahmanullah Lakanwal’s journey from a trusted U.S. battlefield ally to the suspected shooter of two National Guard members on the streets of downtown D.C. remains unclear, in part.
