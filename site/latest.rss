      <title>Scottie Scheffler says ‘a big misunderstanding’ led to his arrest near PGA Championship</title>
      <description>Scheffler, the top-ranked golfer in the world, was arrested Friday morning over a traffic-related incident as he was attempting to enter Valhalla Golf Club, the site of the PGA Championship. “It was a very chaotic situation, understandably so considering the tragic accident that had occurred earlier, and there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do,” he said in a statement shortly before beginning his second round. Earlier in the day, traffic entering the golf club was backed up because of an overnight fatal accident involving a worker for a tournament vendor.</description>

      <title>Public concern over safety in D.C. grows despite drop in crime, Post-Schar School poll finds</title>
      <description>D.C. residents are more worried about public safety now than they were a year ago despite a significant drop in violent crime in early 2024 and a raft of popular local legislation aimed at curtailing some of the city’s more progressive public safety policies, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll. Sixty-five percent of Washingtonians say crime is an “extremely” or a “very serious” problem in the District, up from 56 percent in 2023. While 70 percent of D.C. residents feel at least “somewhat” safe from crime in their neighborhoods, that is down from 77 percent last year. That includes 23 percent who feel “very safe,” down slightly from 29 percent last year.</description>

But it may not have much practical effect, since solar power remains popular in the state and polls show Floridians remain highly concerned about climate change and sea-level rise.</description>
