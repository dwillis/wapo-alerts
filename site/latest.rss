      <title>MLB team owners approve Baltimore Orioles sale. The deal shifts control of the team to David Rubenstein just before Opening Day.</title>
      <description>Rubenstein, one of the founders of the Carlyle Group private equity firm, and a cohort of investors reached an agreement with the Angelos family in January; their pact makes the Baltimore native the team’s “control person,” the term Major League Baseball uses to designate the lead decision-maker for a franchise. The Orioles are set to face the Los Angeles Angels on Thursday in Baltimore.</description>

      <title>Daniel Kahneman dies at 90. The Nobel-winning economist and author of ‘Thinking, Fast and Slow’ studied how people abandon logic.</title>
      <description>Kahneman shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in economics with Vernon L. Smith. His research debunked the notion of “homo economicus,” the “economic man” who since the epoch of Adam Smith was considered a rational being who acts out of self-interest. Instead, Kahneman found, people rely on intellectual shortcuts that often lead to wrongheaded decisions that go against their own best interest.</description>

      <title>Supreme Court seems unlikely to restrict access to the widely used abortion pill mifepristone</title>
      <description>Less than two years after the Supreme Court overturned the right to an abortion guaranteed by Roe v. Wade, a majority of justices seemed skeptical that the antiabortion doctors challenging access to the medication used in more than 60 percent of U.S. abortions had standing to sue. The court will rule by late June or early July on whether to continue to allow mifepristone to be sent by mail, prescribed without an in-person medical visit and used up to 10 weeks into pregnancy.</description>

Four previous cease-fire resolutions had failed, including one proposed by the United States on Friday. The American abstention is likely to further strain U.S. relations with Israel amid sharp disagreements over Israel’s planned military offensive in Rafah.</description>

      <title>Companies are vying to bring back supersonic air travel. Here’s what to know about their efforts — and the likelihood of success.</title>
      <description>There hasn’t been a commercial supersonic passenger jet since the Concorde stopped flying in 2003. Since then, supersonic jets have been used primarily by the military. Now NASA and a growing number of private companies are promising to bring back a form of modern supersonic travel that will be quieter, greener and more affordable than in the past. But there are questions about whether they can make good on their claims, given the economics of air travel and growing concerns about the impact of commercial aviation on the environment.</description>
