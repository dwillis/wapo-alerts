      <title>Noah Lyles was a reminder of the pandemic on the night he could've become an Olympic legend, columnist Jerry Brewer writes</title>
      <description>The U.S. sprinter finished third in the 200-meter race he was widely expected to win, then revealed he had tested positive for the coronavirus and indicated his Paris Games were over. Although we thought covid was behind us, Brewer writes, Thursday felt like the pandemic-affected 2021 Tokyo Olympics.</description>

      <title>With Harris and Walz in, some Democrats still consider withholding their vote in response to the Israel-Gaza war</title>
      <description>During the primaries, pro-Palestinian activists urged voters to withhold their support for President Joe Biden over his handling of the war. Roughly 700,000 Democrats nationwide checked a no-candidate option, left their presidential ballot blank or wrote in someone (or something) else. While that represents a tiny sliver of the electorate — and analysts lack data on each voter’s motivation — some strategists said the apparent protest turnout revealed weak spots for Kamala Harris’s campaign.</description>

      <title>Day 13 highlights from Paris Olympics: Holloway, Davis-Woodhall win big in track and field; U.S. men's basketball survives scare</title>
      <description>Grant Holloway cruised to victory in the men's 110-meter hurdles while Tara Davis-Woodhall captured her first Olympic gold, but they were perhaps overshadowed by Noah Lyles's bronze in the 200 meters and subsequent revelation that he ran with covid-19. In other events, the U.S. men's basketball team trailed for more than 35 of 40 minutes versus Nikola Jokic and Serbia but narrowly avoided what would have been its first Olympic loss since the 2004 Athens Games.</description>

      <title>Trump and Harris confirm they will attend ABC’s Sept. 10 presidential debate as scheduled, network says</title>
      <description>Former president Donald Trump said in a Thursday news conference that he wants to debate his opponent three times, including the Sept. 10 date that was previously agreed to by both parties’ campaigns before President Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 race. That date will serve as the first time Trump and Kamala Harris will share a stage since she was tapped to replace Biden weeks ago.</description>

      <description>Lyles previously won the 100-meter dash and will race for at least one more gold in Paris. He was trying to become the first man since Jamaican Usain Bolt to win the 100 and 200 in the same Games, and the first American man since Carl Lewis in 1984.</description>

      <title>Surprise Ukrainian attack in western Russia stuns Moscow and raises questions about Kyiv’s use of U.S.-donated weapons</title>
      <description>A cross-border assault by Ukrainian forces into the Kursk region that began Tuesday raised questions about whether Kyiv’s forces violated Western restrictions on the use of fighting vehicles and weapons donated by the United States and other countries. The operation, which Ukrainian officials have declined to comment on, is the largest Ukrainian incursion on Russian territory since 2022. It could mark a new chapter in the war.</description>

      <title>Trump has been complaining about his campaign to friends and advisers as Harris’s poll numbers surge</title>
      <description>The GOP nominee has grown increasingly upset about Kamala Harris’s crowd sizes and media coverage since she replaced Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket. The situation has left people close to the campaign wondering why Donald Trump and his team seemed ill-prepared for Harris’s entry into the race after Biden’s disastrous June debate performance.</description>

      <title>Tim Walz’s Army record faces scrutiny as GOP critics, fellow veterans question claims about his service</title>
      <description>The Harris-Walz campaign has cited the vice-presidential candidate's 24 years of military experience as an asset. But Republicans and some who served with the Minnesota governor have decried his decision to retire before their National Guard unit went to war and his characterization of aspects of his time in uniform.</description>

      <description>In her most extensive remarks yet about the the political earthquake of the past few weeks, the former House speaker said she was concerned President Joe Biden staying in the race would inevitably lead to the reelection of Donald Trump. Pelosi, who carries tremendous clout on Capitol Hill and in the Democratic Party, also said that while she did not make any phone calls seeking Biden’s ouster, “hundreds” of people who wanted to see that outcome called her.</description>

      <title>Trump took a private flight with Project 2025’s leader in 2022. He recently claimed he had ‘no idea who is in charge of it.’</title>
      <description>Former president Donald Trump shared a 45-minute chartered flight with Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts in April 2022, according to people familiar with the trip, plane-tracking data and a photograph from the plane. Trump was traveling to speak at a Heritage Foundation conference, where he said, “They’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do.”

The flight and Trump’s comments from the time undercut the former president’s recent efforts to distance himself from Project 2025 once Democrats turned some of its most controversial proposals into a frequent campaign attack.</description>

But military officials involved in those discussions say she didn’t significantly affect Biden’s determination to leave — or alter plans that led to a chaotic and deadly evacuation.</description>
