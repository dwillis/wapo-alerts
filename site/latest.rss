      <title>Correction: Lawmakers expensed millions in 2023 under a new program that doesn’t require receipts. An earlier alert incorrectly said Rep. Gaetz was the top spender.</title>
      <description>he program, which kicked off last year after a House panel passed it with bipartisan support, was intended to make it easier for lawmakers to cover the cost of maintaining separate residences in D.C. and their home districts. But critics argue that its reliance on the honor system and lack of transparent record-keeping makes it ripe for abuse.

An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) was the reimbursement program’s top spender in 2023. That analysis was based on data released by the House as of last week. But additional data The Post reviewed Tuesday showed that Rep. Jack Bergman (R-Mich.) was reimbursed for more than Gaetz was. This article has been updated and alert corrected.</description>

      <title>FDA panel recommends against approving MDMA to treat PTSD. It’s unclear whether the agency will authorize the novel treatment.</title>
      <description>Committee members said there is not enough evidence that use of the drug, also known as ecstasy, can be used safely and effectively. But the Food and Drug Administration sometimes sets aside recommendations of its advisory panels, so there’s still a chance the agency will approve the first-of-its kind application for a psychedelic drug.</description>

      <title>Biden plans to sign executive order that returns migrants to Mexico when illegal crossings exceed daily limit, officials say</title>
      <description>President Biden is expected to issue an order Tuesday that would shut off access to the U.S. asylum system when illegal border crossings exceed a daily threshold, according to four administration officials and people with knowledge of the plans.

Migrants would be ineligible for asylum consideration once the limit is surpassed, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a pending White House order.</description>

      <title>During the coronavirus pandemic, we were told to stay 6 feet apart. There’s no science to support that.</title>
      <description>Physicians at the forefront of the country’s response to the health crisis, including infectious-disease expert Anthony S. Fauci, have acknowledged the six-foot rule “wasn’t based on data.” It remains clear that social distancing measures saved lives, but the reasons for telling people to maintain six feet of separation in public — compared with the World Health Organization’s recommendation of about three feet — are not clear.</description>
