      <title>Noah Lyles was a reminder of the pandemic on the night he could've become an Olympic legend, columnist Jerry Brewer writes</title>
      <description>The U.S. sprinter finished third in the 200-meter race he was widely expected to win, then revealed he had tested positive for the coronavirus and indicated his Paris Games were over. Although we thought covid was behind us, Brewer writes, Thursday felt like the pandemic-affected 2021 Tokyo Olympics.</description>

      <title>With Harris and Walz in, some Democrats still consider withholding their vote in response to the Israel-Gaza war</title>
      <description>During the primaries, pro-Palestinian activists urged voters to withhold their support for President Joe Biden over his handling of the war.

      <title>Day 13 highlights from Paris Olympics: Holloway, Davis-Woodhall win big in track and field; U.S. men's basketball survives scare</title>
      <description>Grant Holloway cruised to victory in the men's 110-meter hurdles while Tara Davis-Woodhall captured her first Olympic gold, but they were perhaps overshadowed by Noah Lyles's bronze in the 200 meters and subsequent revelation that he ran with covid-19. In other events, the U.S. men's basketball team trailed for more than 35 of 40 minutes versus Nikola Jokic and Serbia but narrowly avoided what would have been its first Olympic loss since the 2004 Athens Games.</description>
