      <description>The Washington Post was first to report on the U.S. Coast Guard’s plan to revise its workplace harassment policy. The Trump administration had sought to label the article as “false” — but within hours of its publication, the service’s acting commandant had issued a memo forcefully denouncing the symbols. It was not immediately clear Tuesday why publication of the new policy was not edited to align with the admiral’s directive.</description>
