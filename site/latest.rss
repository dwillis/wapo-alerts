      <title>Meta embraces Elon Musk’s volunteer fact-checking program on X. Its users describe it as ‘whack-a-mole.’</title>
      <description>The legions of X users who volunteer their time policing misinformation on the site through a feature called Community Notes praise the program for giving power to a diverse set of users. But they also warn it’s an inadequate replacement for professional fact-checking — and fear it will be even harder for regular people to combat falsehoods on Meta’s array of global platforms. Some users said their efforts feel futile.</description>

      <title>Biden will defer to Trump on terrorist designation for Syria’s new leaders</title>
      <description>The terrorist designation for Hayʼat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, will remain in place through the end of President Joe Biden’s term, said three U.S. officials familiar with the matter. The label is a key obstacle to Syria’s long-term economic viability, but U.S. officials said the Islamist militants who stunned the world late last year by overthrowing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must demonstrate they’ve made a clean break with extremist groups, in particular al-Qaeda.</description>

      <title>Why the L.A. fires became so bad, so quickly</title>
      <description>For days, the National Weather Service warned of extreme fire risk amid a “life-threatening” and “destructive” windstorm. Those dire predictions came true as devastating wildfires broke out across the city — some in mountainous zones where the strongest winds had been predicted. Hurricane-force Santa Ana winds, some gusting to nearly 90 mph, and bone-dry conditions helped fuel the fast spread of numerous fires. Winds were expected to intensify Wednesday.</description>

      <title>Justice Department plans to release special counsel report on Trump Jan. 6 probe, withhold classified document report for now</title>
      <description>The Justice Department said in a court filing that it would not publicly release special counsel Jack Smith’s findings on Donald Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified documents until the ongoing litigation against his co-defendants concludes. But prosecutors said Attorney General Merrick Garland intends to release a portion of Smith’s report outlining his investigation into Trump’s efforts to undo the results of the 2020 election and allow members of Congress to review the portions withheld on the classified documents investigation.</description>

      <title>Trump asks Supreme Court to halt Friday sentencing in New York hush money case</title>
      <description>President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to quickly intervene to delay his sentencing Friday in his criminal hush money case in New York. Trump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records and will be the first U.S. president with a criminal record. The trial judge has said he will not give Trump jail time or probation but wants to hold the sentencing hearing to honor the gravity of the jury’s verdict.</description>

      <title>Peter Yarrow dies at 86. The singer-songwriter found fame as part of the influential folk music trio Peter, Paul and Mary.</title>
      <description>The group helped stir the folk music revival in the 1960s by popularizing songs of protest and social change, including “Blowin’ in the Wind” and “If I Had a Hammer.” Yarrow co-wrote the hit “Puff, the Magic Dragon.” Yarrow’s reputation was tarnished after a guilty plea on charges related to a sexual encounter with a minor. He was pardoned by President Jimmy Carter.</description>

      <description>Fighters for the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces are committing genocide in Sudan, the State Department said Tuesday, and the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the group's chief, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti. The RSF has “systematically murdered men and boys — even infants — on an ethnic basis, and deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.</description>

      <title>The fate of nearly 1,600 Jan. 6 defendants depends on President-elect Donald Trump</title>
      <description>Many charged in connection with the attack on the Capitol four years ago have seized on Trump’s promise to pardon an unspecified number of Jan. 6 defendants. Will he extend mercy only to those accused of misdemeanors like trespassing, who crossed police lines and entered the Capitol as part of the mob? Or would he also pardon those charged or convicted of violent felonies such as assaulting law enforcement officers or others?</description>
