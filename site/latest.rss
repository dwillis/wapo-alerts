      <title>House GOP leadership is set to propose a third funding plan today in hopes of averting a government shutdown. Follow our coverage.</title>
      <description>After the failure of a Trump-backed plan, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) was considering offering two options hours before a midnight deadline. One would extend the current fiscal levels until mid-March and a farm bill for one year, and includes $110 billion for natural disasters. It would not include Trump’s demand for raising the debt ceiling. Another plan floated is just a clean extension, known as a continuing resolution or CR, for several weeks into the new year.</description>
