      <description>In 1970, Lovell shepherded Apollo 13 on its lunar voyage, including a perilous journey back to Earth after an oxygen tank exploded. “Houston, we’ve had a problem,” Lovell told Mission Control as the ordeal transfixed the world.
Apollo 13 became a saga of mythological proportions, especially after the film that starred Tom Hanks as Lovell.</description>

      <description>One of the subpoenas focused on James’s successful civil fraud case against Donald Trump and his real estate empire, which resulted in a judge ruling in 2024 that Trump and his company needed to pay $450 million in fines, people familiar with the probe said. A second subpoena suggested that the Justice Department is looking into James’s high-profile litigation against the National Rifle Association, which led to court-mandated changes for the group, they said.</description>

      <title>Trump’s tariffs take effect, potentially upending global trade and prices</title>
      <description>The president has already announced frameworks of trade agreements with roughly a dozen of the country’s closest trading partners, including the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan and South Korea.
But goods from nations with which the U.S. does hundreds of billions of dollars of trade, such as India, Switzerland and South Africa, will see new taxes of up to 39 percent, with India’s rate set to jump to 50 percent in three weeks. Economists say the sweeping new taxes on imports will likely get passed on to U.S. consumers and businesses.</description>

      <title>Research on reversing Alzheimer’s reveals lithium as a potential key</title>
      <description>Scientists at Harvard Medical School have reported that they were able to reverse the disease in mice and restore brain function with small amounts of the compound lithium orotate, enough to mimic the metal’s natural level in the brain. The finding could lead to earlier detection of Alzheimer's, new treatments and a broader understanding of how the human brain ages.</description>
