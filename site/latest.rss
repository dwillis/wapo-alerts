      <title>Elon Musk’s DOGE team is feeding sensitive federal data into AI via Microsoft's cloud to target spending cuts</title>
      <description>Musk’s representatives from the Department of Government Efficiency have fed data from across the Education Department — including personally identifiable information for people who manage grants and sensitive internal financial data — into artificial intelligence software to probe the agency’s programs and spending, according to two people with knowledge of the actions.

This use of AI, which has not previously been reported, shows how Musk’s group, which includes former employees from his tech empire, is tapping the favorite tool of Silicon Valley as part of its mission to drastically slash the size and functions of the federal government.</description>

      <title>China considers pulling the plug on TikTok in the U.S. as it waits for a ‘grand deal’ on trade with Trump</title>
      <description>TikTok’s Chinese owner appears to be slow-rolling negotiations for a sale while waiting for a green light from the Chinese government, even as corporate allies of President Donald Trump race to broker a deal to sell the app to an American bidder, according to three people familiar with the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private business transactions.

But Beijing is increasingly likely to take a hard-line approach, letting TikTok’s U.S. operations die rather than approving a sale as it holds out for a “grand deal” with the Trump administration.</description>

      <title>Most USAID workers to be put on leave as all overseas staff are recalled, Trump administration says</title>
      <description>The move is the latest action in a jarring broadside against America’s foreign aid architecture that has followed President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. In the weeks since his inauguration, the new administration has announced a broad freeze on foreign aid programs — unleashing upheaval across the aid sector and financial crises for groups reliant on USAID funding — and fired, furloughed or put on leave the bulk of AID employees.</description>
