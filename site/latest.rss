      <title>Biden administration greenlights more bombs and warplanes for Israel despite widening rift with Netanyahu</title>
      <description>The State Department in recent days quietly approved the transfer to Israel of billions of dollars in bombs and fighter jets despite Washington’s concerns about an anticipated military offensive in southern Gaza that could threaten the lives of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. The arms packages include more than 1,800 MK84 2,000-pound bombs, which have been linked to previous mass-casualty events.</description>

      <title>Officials guarded Baltimore’s Key Bridge from terrorism and decay for decades. They didn’t foresee a ship collision.</title>
      <description>After the Sept. 11 attacks and the 2007 Minneapolis bridge collapse, Maryland officials scrambled to ensure the bridge was safe from similar events. Then, this week, a 95,000-gross-ton container ship hit it.</description>

      <title>Louis Gossett Jr. dies at 87. He was the first Black man to win the best supporting actor Oscar.</title>
      <description>In a career spanning nearly seven decades, Gossett became one of the most recognizable actors of his generation. He worked on Broadway and other stages starting in the 1950s, appearing in dramas such as Lorraine Hansberry’s landmark “A Raisin in the Sun.” The boundary-breaking actor later won an Emmy for “Roots” (1977) and an Academy Award for “An Officer and a Gentleman” (1982).</description>

      <title>Biden seeks to accelerate the nation’s transition to electric trucks and buses, a follow-up to tougher rules on cars</title>
      <description>The Environmental Protection Agency finalized a rule requiring manufacturers to reduce emissions from new trucks, delivery vans and buses.

The rule — aimed at reducing climate impacts — could also cut harmful air pollution in disadvantaged communities. Some truck makers had lobbied to weaken it and might challenge it in court.</description>

      <title>Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) vetoes bills that would have created a legal market for recreational cannabis in Virginia</title>
      <description>Passed on largely party-line votes by the Democratic-controlled General Assembly, the identical House of Delegates and Senate bills would have set commercial standards and licensing requirements for large and small retailers to sell cannabis products. Virginia legalized the possession of small amounts of recreational marijuana three years ago but never settled on a mechanism to allow legal sales.</description>

      <title>The Dodgers took a risk when they committed so much to Shohei Ohtani. They decided it was worth it.</title>
      <description>The Los Angeles Dodgers did not commit to the two-time MVP from Japan solely because of the value he can provide on the field. Adding Ohtani to the most star-studded roster in the sport felt to them as though it would create off-field value of an entirely different scale. But for the first time in his career, the eyes that follow Ohtani, his team and the league that made him its poster child are staring for less flattering reasons.</description>

      <title>South Carolina will proceed with voting map judges previously said ‘exiled’ Black voters rather than wait for Supreme Court decision</title>
      <description>A federal court ruled Thursday that time had run out to draw a new congressional district in South Carolina and said the state could use its existing map this year even though it had earlier determined that map was unconstitutional. The panel of three judges last year concluded that South Carolina’s Republican-led legislature “exiled” 30,000 Black voters from the district to make it safer for a White GOP incumbent, Rep. Nancy Mace. The Supreme Court heard arguments on the case in October but has yet to rule on it.</description>

      <title>Joe Lieberman has died at 82. The doggedly independent four-term U.S. senator was also a vice-presidential candidate.</title>
      <description>As Al Gore's running mate in 2000, he was the first Jewish candidate on the national ticket of a major party. Eight years later, he supported Republican presidential candidate John McCain over Barack Obama.

Lieberman viewed himself as a centrist Democrat, solidly in his party’s mainstream with his support of abortion rights, environmental protection, gay rights and gun control. But he was also unafraid to stray from Democratic orthodoxy, most notably in his consistently hawkish stands on foreign policy.</description>

The new calculations suggest that in 2029 it may be necessary to insert a “negative leap second” into the calendar to get the planet’s rotation in sync with Coordinated Universal Time.</description>

      <description>Kahneman shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in economics with Vernon L. Smith. His research debunked the notion of “homo economicus,” the “economic man” who since the epoch of Adam Smith was considered a rational being who acts out of self-interest. Instead, Kahneman found, people rely on intellectual shortcuts that often lead to wrongheaded decisions that go against their own best interest.</description>

      <title>Supreme Court seems unlikely to restrict access to the widely used abortion pill mifepristone</title>
      <description>Less than two years after the Supreme Court overturned the right to an abortion guaranteed by Roe v. Wade, a majority of justices seemed skeptical that the antiabortion doctors challenging access to the medication used in more than 60 percent of U.S. abortions had standing to sue. The court will rule by late June or early July on whether to continue to allow mifepristone to be sent by mail, prescribed without an in-person medical visit and used up to 10 weeks into pregnancy.</description>
