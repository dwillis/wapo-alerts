      <title>They were arrested during routine ICE check-ins. Then they disappeared.</title>
      <description>Family members, lawyers and the public can often get information on detained migrants’ location through an online database, contact with an official or direct phone calls with a detainee. But in the week since the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport 137 Venezuelans to a mega-prison in El Salvador, detainees can no longer be found in that database.</description>

      <title>Canadian prime minister requests dissolution of Parliament and sets snap election as Trump’s threats loom over campaign</title>
      <description>Mark Carney, a former central banker, was sworn in as prime minister earlier this month, taking over as Liberal Party leader from Justin Trudeau. The campaign will take place against the backdrop of President Donald Trump’s trade war and repeated threats to use “economic force” to annex Canada and make it the 51st state.</description>

      <title>Greenland is hard to defend. As Trump threatens to ‘get’ the territory, the Danes are trying.</title>
      <description>Like Ukraine, Greenland possesses the critical and rare metals needed for electric vehicles, smartphones, medical imaging equipment, computer chips and wind turbines. But President Donald Trump’s comments have raised more questions than answers about defense of the world’s largest island.</description>

      <title>IRS nears deal with ICE to share addresses of suspected undocumented immigrants, ending years of assurances about privacy</title>
      <description>Under the draft agreement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be able to submit names and address to the IRS to cross-reference with confidential taxpayer databases, according to four people who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of professional reprisals. The IRS has for years told undocumented workers that their tax information is confidential and that it is safe to file income tax returns without fear of being deported. About half — possibly more — of the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country file income tax returns to document their payments to the U.S. government, according to researchers.</description>

      <title>Trump said he didn’t sign the Alien Enemies Act proclamation. So who — or what — did?</title>
      <description>President Donald Trump told reporters he did not sign the proclamation that he said authorized the rapid deportation of migrants he claims are violent gang members from Venezuela. So what did happen? Did Trump misspeak? Is he trying to deflect responsibility onto Secretary of State Marco Rubio? Did his officials use an autopen? The White House's response created more questions than answers.</description>

      <title>Israel strikes Hezbollah launchers after rockets were fired from Lebanon, killing two, in biggest exchange since ceasefire</title>
      <description>The Israeli Defense Forces and U.N. peacekeepers said projectiles were launched from Lebanon into Israel on Saturday morning. The IDF responded with strikes targeting “dozens of Hezbollah rocket launchers and a command center,” it said. At least two people, including a child, were killed and 10 wounded, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Hezbollah denied launching rockets and said the accusations were “merely pretexts” for “continued attacks on Lebanon, which have not ceased since the ceasefire was announced” in November.</description>

      <title>Kitty Dukakis dies at 88. She carved a distinct identity in public as her husband governed Massachusetts and ran for president.</title>
      <description>Dukakis, who was the wife of former Massachusetts governor and 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, spoke openly about her struggles with addiction and later promoted electroconvulsive therapy as a treatment for depression. She was a social worker, arts patron and activist on behalf of vulnerable populations, from the homeless to the stateless. She said she was “fiercely proud” of her Jewish background, playing a role in the creation of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.</description>

      <description>Foreman died Friday while “surrounded by loved ones,” according to a statement on his verified Instagram account.

      <title>Department of Homeland Security shuts down three internal watchdog agencies, calling them 'roadblocks' to immigration enforcement</title>
      <description>The Department of Homeland Security ordered a “reduction in force” in three agencies that advocated for immigrants and investigated complaints, including about detention conditions and delays in processing green card and citizenship applications. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman and the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman together had about 300 employees. They will be terminated within 60 days if they do not find another assignment inside DHS, a spokeswoman said.</description>

      <description>The administration’s directive has barred the transmission of evidence to prosecutors pursuing multiple criminal cases, including the International Criminal Court’s landmark indictment of Russian President Vladimir Putin for what judges called the “unlawful transfer” of children from Ukraine, U.S. officials told The Post.
