      <title>Dickey Betts dies at 80. The singer and guitarist co-founded the Allman Brothers Band and wrote hits including ‘Ramblin’ Man.’</title>
      <description>Betts wrote several of the band’s most enduring compositions, including the instrumentals “In Memory of Elizabeth Reed” and “Jessica,” and the pastoral love song “Blue Sky.” He remained best known for the 1973 song “Ramblin’ Man,” which became the band’s only top-10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. The lyrics, set against a bouncy, upbeat melody, expressed the resigned and unrepentant wanderlust of a man “born in the back seat of a Greyhound bus / Rollin’ down Highway 41.”</description>

In a complaint to Congress, a senior Air Force leader deployed in Niger accused top officials at the U.S. Embassy there of having “intentionally suppressed intelligence” as they seek to maintain the “facade of a great country-to-country relationship.” Administration officials rejected the whistleblower’s claims.</description>

      <description>Gov. Glenn Youngkin met with General Assembly leaders to find a way around a budget impasse over taxes and spending priorities, according to two people close to the arrangements who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private negotiations. Lawmakers and the governor agreed to create a new budget and hold a special legislative session, probably in mid-May, to wrap up the budget process well before the June 30 deadline.</description>

      <title>‘Dead ships’: Before a cargo ship hit Baltimore’s Key Bridge, hundreds of others lost propulsion in U.S. waters in recent years</title>
      <description>A Washington Post analysis of Coast Guard records found that 424 cargo ships longer than 600 feet reported losing propulsion — meaning the engines were shut down — in U.S. waters during the three years before the Key Bridge disaster in Baltimore. About a quarter of the incidents occurred near a port, bridge or other infrastructure. Experts say a lack of consistent rules on when cargo ships should be escorted by supportive tug boats adds to the danger.</description>

      <title>Seven jurors picked to serve on Trump hush money jury, and other key takeaways</title>
      <description>Manhattanites spilled into a courtroom on Tuesday and were quizzed about their media diet, hobbies and families — all to see if they could be fair jurors in the criminal trial of former president Donald Trump,, who also happens to be the likely 2024 Republican presidential nominee. Seven were chosen, and some were passed over for problematic social media posts or other reasons. Opening statements could be as soon as Monday, the judge said.</description>

      <title>Momentum builds to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson as two fellow Republicans say they would vote to remove him</title>
      <description>Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) announced Tuesday morning he would join Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-Ga.) bid to depose Johnson (R-La.) after the speaker introduced a complex foreign aid package decoupling Israel from Ukraine aid.

Neither Massie nor Green has officially brought up the so-called motion to vacate, which would trigger a vote on Johnson’s leadership. But Republicans are now one vote short of being able to oust him if Democrats don’t step in to support him.</description>
