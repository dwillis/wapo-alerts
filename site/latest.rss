      <description>Former president Donald Trump spoke by phone this week with a Nebraska state senator as part of a last-minute push to block the easiest path Vice President Kamala Harris has to win the White House by changing how the state allocates its electoral votes. Sen. Merv Riepe (R) said he spoke briefly by phone with Trump on Wednesday in the presence of Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen (R) during a visit by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who traveled to the state to encourage Republicans in the state’s unicameral legislature to change to a statewide winner-take-all electoral vote system.</description>

      <title>Harris and Trump essentially tied in Pennsylvania one week after the debate, Post poll finds</title>
      <description>Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump are locked in a statistical tie in Pennsylvania, according to a Washington Post poll of a state that many analysts see as the battleground most likely to determine the outcome of the presidential election. One week after a debate that Pennsylvania voters widely say Harris won, she is favored by 48 percent of both likely voters and registered voters, while Trump is supported by 47 percent of voters in both categories. Third-party candidates are not a major factor in the race, The Post’s poll finds: After excluding minor candidates, Harris and Trump are both at 48 percent among likely voters, with Harris at 48 percent and Trump at 47 percent among registered voters.</description>

      <title>A journey from N.C. to Ukraine to suspect in apparent Trump assassination attempt</title>
      <description>Ryan Routh’s long and strange journey from running a roofing company to being the suspect in what the FBI has called an apparent assassination attempt in Florida left friends and acquaintances mystified. He could be odd, many of them said, and had a history of mostly minor run-ins with police, but wasn’t threatening. Still, in recent years, there were hints of a kind of unraveling, particularly since he went to Ukraine in 2022. While Routh saw himself engaged in a Manichaean battle of good evil, others found his activities there counterproductive and disturbing — so much so that they flagged him to U.S. government agencies, they said.</description>
