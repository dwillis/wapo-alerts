      <title>Hegseth tries to distance himself from boat strike fallout as White House emphasizes admiral’s role</title>
      <description>The Washington Post reported exclusively Friday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a spoken order to kill the entire crew of a vessel thought to be ferrying narcotics in the Caribbean Sea. When two survivors were detected, the military commander overseeing the operation, Adm. Frank M.

      <title>The alleged National Guard shooter once served in an elite CIA-backed unit. But his life unraveled as a refugee in the U.S.</title>
      <description>The course of Rahmanullah Lakanwal’s journey from a trusted U.S. battlefield ally to the suspected shooter of two National Guard members on the streets of downtown D.C. remains unclear, in part.
