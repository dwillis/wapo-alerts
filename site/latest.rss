      <title>Trump defends late-night purge that ousted at least 15 independent inspectors general</title>
      <description>“I don’t know them,” the president said Saturday night, even though many of those he fired were appointed during his first term. The dismissals appeared to violate federal law, which requires Congress to receive 30 days’ notice of any intent to fire a Senate-confirmed inspector general.</description>

      <title>Four female hostages are back in Israel and reunited with their families, while 200 Palestinian prisoners have been released, Israel says</title>
      <description>The four female soldiers were released earlier than expected on Saturday, in the second week of a protracted ceasefire and hostage release deal that has halted 15 months of fighting. However, Israel said Hamas had violated the agreement to release all living civilian women first, and that it would delay withdrawing its troops from north Gaza as a result.</description>

      <title>Trump fires at least 12 independent inspectors general in late-night purge</title>
      <description>The White House is firing many inspectors general — the independent watchdogs at major Cabinet departments charged with identifying fraud and abuse. It is a purge that could lead to the president installing loyalists to the crucial roles overseeing major agencies like Energy and Transportation. Most of those dismissed were Trump appointees from his first term.</description>

      <title>Pete Hegseth confirmed as Trump’s defense secretary, an appointment expected to bring a dramatic shift in national security policy</title>
      <description>The former Fox News personality, whose nomination was overshadowed by a raft of misconduct allegations, overcame withering opposition from lawmakers who deemed him unfit to run the Pentagon and oversee the nation’s military.

Three Republicans, Sens. Mitch McConnell (Kentucky), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Susan Collins (Maine), joined the chamber’s Democrats in opposing his nomination. Vice President JD Vance cast the tiebreaking vote.</description>

      <title>Justice Dept. to sharply curtail prosecutions of antiabortion protesters who disrupt access to clinics</title>
      <description>A day after President Donald Trump pardoned 23 people convicted under the 1994 FACE Act, the Justice Department said it would drop three pending cases and would prosecute future cases only under "extraordinary circumstances," including if protesters cause “death, serious bodily harm, or serious property damage.” Trump and his allies have accused the Biden administration of bringing cases against "peaceful pro-life protestors."</description>

      <title>Immigration raids are alarming communities, but ICE has arrested fewer people this week than when Trump took office in 2017</title>
      <description>The Trump administration circulated photos Friday showing U.S. troops loading shackled detainees onto a military cargo plane, as the White House declared a start to the mass deportation campaign the president promised along the campaign trail. But ICE arrest numbers suggest the show of force has so far outpaced the government’s capacity to quickly increase deportations.</description>

      <description>The China-based company said it would "go dark" unless the outgoing administration assured the app's service providers they would not be punished under the ban-or-sale law.
