      <title>President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance to speak at memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Follow our coverage.</title>
      <description>The president, vice president and Kirk's widow, Erika, will speak to the tens of thousands of supporters gathered to mourn Kirk and highlight the contributions his organization, Turning Point USA, has made to the modern Republican Party. The scale and security of the event is on par with a state funeral, and the attendance of high-level political figures is notable, given that Kirk was a private citizen who was not well-known to a large swath of Americans until his death.</description>

      <title>Trump administration set to tie Tylenol to autism risk, officials say</title>
      <description>Federal officials have been reviewing a possible link between Tylenol's early use in pregnancy and an increased risk of autism in children — a connection that researchers say needs more studies to draw conclusions. They are also expected to tout a lesser-known drug, leucovorin, as a potential treatment. President Donald Trump has prioritized the initiatives, although outside researchers have called for further study.</description>

      <title>Most Americans critical of Trump on crime, economy and other issues, Post-Ipsos poll finds</title>
      <description>A Washington Post-Ipsos poll paints a downbeat picture of Donald Trump’s presidency eight months into his second term. Despite a slight uptick in his overall approval rating compared with April, Americans disapprove of his performance on a broad range of issues — crime, the economy, immigration, foreign wars — and all by double-digit margins. Republicans hold advantages over Democrats on trust to handle crime, the economy and immigration, though a majority of Americans still say they want Democrats to control the next Congress “as a check on Trump.”</description>

      <title>DEA’s push for Mexico strikes faced resistance at White House and Pentagon after some warned Congress had not authorized such action</title>
      <description>In the opening weeks of President Donald Trump’s second term, Drug Enforcement Administration officials suggested targeting cartel leadership and conducting attacks on infrastructure in Mexico, unnerving some U.S. officials who argued that such strikes had no basis in law, said people familiar with the deliberations. The suggestion was not acted upon, though Trump has repeatedly expressed a desire to use military force to halt narcotics flowing over the southern border.</description>
