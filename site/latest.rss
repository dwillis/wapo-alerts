      <title>Pete Rose dies at 83. The Cincinnati Reds star awed fans but was banished from baseball after gambling on his team as manager.</title>
      <description>Known as “Charlie Hustle” for his aggressive style of play, Rose won two World Series titles with his hometown team on his path to breaking the all-time hits record.
In 1989, reports surfaced that he was deep in debt from gambling. Major League Baseball’s commissioner’s office released a report that year with testimony from Rose’s bookies that he bet on baseball — including the Reds, while he was managing the team — during the 1985, ’86 and ’87 seasons. He was banished from the game and excluded from the Hall of Fame.</description>

      <title>This photo of a lavish breakfast on the National Mall captivated the country. The real story was a mystery — until now.</title>
      <description>In 1974, a dozen friends wore morning coats and floor-length dresses, dined on oysters, drank champagne and danced together as a string quartet played in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial. The extravagant scene drew in a Washington Post photographer, who captured the moment in a mysterious image that would ricochet around the country in newspaper reprints.

      <description>A Washington Post examination revealed that filthy conditions, aging equipment and haphazard cleaning at the plant may have made some of its products microbial time bombs waiting to explode.

The hunt for the deadly agent unfurled across a month and a half — an effort The Post reconstructed through more than two dozen interviews with former Boar’s Head employees; victims, their families and lawyers; and public health officials and food safety experts as well as a review of more than 150 pages of documents.</description>
