      <title>GOP-run House votes to hold Garland in contempt after he refused to turn over Biden interview tapes in classified documents probe</title>
      <description>The vote targeting Attorney General Merrick Garland was a show of Republicans’ displeasure that the Biden administration refuses to turn over audiotapes of President Biden’s interview with federal investigators about classified documents found in his home and former office. The Justice Department has already turned over the transcripts but says handing over the recordings would set a bad precedent.</description>

      <description>The Washington Post installed cameras along the main road of one North Carolina town to document the many ways rising seas exacerbate high-tide flooding.

      <title>‘Gaslit by doctors,’ some patients are turning to a shadow system of at-home tests</title>
      <description>A new world of DIY testing is allowing patients to bypass the doctor’s office and take medical tests on their own.

      <title>Home insurance was once a ‘must.’ Now more homeowners are going without.</title>
