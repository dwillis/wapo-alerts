      <title>TikTok files court challenge to law that could lead to its ban, setting up what could be an existential fight for the popular app</title>

      <title>Stormy Daniels, testifying now, recounts how she came to meet Trump in a hotel room — and the pajamas she said he was wearing</title>
      <description>Daniels, who alleged that she had a sexual encounter with Donald Trump years before he sought the presidency, is testifying this morning in his criminal trial. Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records related to his reimbursement of his then-lawyer Michael Cohen for a hush money payment made to the adult-film actress shortly before the 2016 election, which was meant to keep her from publicly sharing her story.</description>

But the Israeli government also vowed to maintain military pressure on Rafah, where airstrikes and a mass evacuation order stirred panic among the more than a million displaced Palestinians sheltering there.</description>

      <title>Laura Loomer’s far-right rhetoric has repelled many would-be MAGA allies, with one notable exception: Trump himself</title>
      <description>People around the former president apparently see Loomer — an anti-Islam, anti-immigration activist — as a liability at a time when Donald Trump’s campaign (if not the candidate himself) is making a conscious effort to make their man appear less extreme, according to several sources close to the campaign’s inner circle. Still, Loomer is dead set on landing a role in a second Trump administration.</description>

      <title>Chris Pratt’s demolition of a historic home to build a modern farmhouse is part of a disturbing trend</title>
      <description>Few people realized the Zimmerman House in Los Angeles was in any danger before it was unceremoniously razed by the actor and his wife, author Katherine Schwarzenegger, who bought the mid-century home and its nearly one-acre plot last year for $12.5 million. Increasingly, preservationists say, these demos are not driven by changing tastes but rather by Americans’ ravenous appetites for larger and larger homes.</description>

      <description>The three men are Indian Canadians believed to be part of an organized crime network acting on the behalf of the Indian government and its intelligence apparatus, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive law enforcement matter.
