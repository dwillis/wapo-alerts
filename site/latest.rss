Trump said that 800 National Guard members have been activated, and there will be “much more if necessary, much more.”</description>

      <title>Trump’s tariffs take effect, potentially upending global trade and prices</title>
      <description>The president has already announced frameworks of trade agreements with roughly a dozen of the country’s closest trading partners, including the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan and South Korea.
But goods from nations with which the U.S. does hundreds of billions of dollars of trade, such as India, Switzerland and South Africa, will see new taxes of up to 39 percent, with India’s rate set to jump to 50 percent in three weeks. Economists say the sweeping new taxes on imports will likely get passed on to U.S. consumers and businesses.</description>
