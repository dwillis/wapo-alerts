      <description>President Donald Trump’s executive order requires voters to provide government-issued documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote.

They also said the measure is illegal and would prompt litigation.</description>

      <title>Elon Musk once tacitly backed DEI. Now he’s focused on anti-White bias.</title>
      <description>Musk, who was raised during South African apartheid, used to steer clear of debate about race. But as he wields more power as head of the U.S. DOGE Service, part of his playbook now involves amplifying controversial opinions on racially sensitive topics — including what he sees as racism against White people.</description>

      <title>They were arrested during routine ICE check-ins. Then they disappeared.</title>
      <description>Family members, lawyers and the public can often get information on detained migrants’ location through an online database, contact with an official or direct phone calls with a detainee. But in the week since the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport 137 Venezuelans to a mega-prison in El Salvador, detainees can no longer be found in that database.</description>

      <title>IRS nears deal with ICE to share addresses of suspected undocumented immigrants, ending years of assurances about privacy</title>
      <description>Under the draft agreement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be able to submit names and address to the IRS to cross-reference with confidential taxpayer databases, according to four people who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of professional reprisals. The IRS has for years told undocumented workers that their tax information is confidential and that it is safe to file income tax returns without fear of being deported. About half — possibly more — of the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country file income tax returns to document their payments to the U.S. government, according to researchers.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump told reporters he did not sign the proclamation that he said authorized the rapid deportation of migrants he claims are violent gang members from Venezuela. So what did happen? Did Trump misspeak? Is he trying to deflect responsibility onto Secretary of State Marco Rubio? Did his officials use an autopen? The White House's response created more questions than answers.</description>

      <description>The Israeli Defense Forces and U.N. peacekeepers said projectiles were launched from Lebanon into Israel on Saturday morning. The IDF responded with strikes targeting “dozens of Hezbollah rocket launchers and a command center,” it said. At least two people, including a child, were killed and 10 wounded, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Hezbollah denied launching rockets and said the accusations were “merely pretexts” for “continued attacks on Lebanon, which have not ceased since the ceasefire was announced” in November.</description>
