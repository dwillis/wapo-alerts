      <description>Russ Vought, the former president’s budget director, is laying the groundwork for a philosophy he calls “radical constitutionalism.” Vought envisions Donald Trump seizing new control over the military, federal agencies and spending — an agenda he is poised to steer from an influential perch if Trump is reelected, possibly as his chief of staff.</description>

      <title>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas acknowledges two 2019 trips paid for by Harlan Crow, adding them to annual disclosure forms</title>
      <description>Thomas acknowledged that the Texas billionaire who is his longtime benefactor paid for his 2019 visits to a resort in Bali and the private Bohemian Grove club in California. On their annual disclosure forms, Justices Brett M. Kavanaugh, Neil M. Gorsuch and Ketanji Brown Jackson reported lucrative book deals, and  Jackson reported concert tickets from Beyoncé. The justices' off-the-bench activities have been scrutinized and criticized in the past year following reports by ProPublica and other media outlets that Thomas failed to disclose years of luxury vacations and private jet travel.</description>

      <title>Birth control access could be threatened as conservatives mischaracterize IUDs and emergency contraception as causing abortions</title>
      <description>Since the Supreme Court overturned the right to abortion two years ago, far-right conservatives have been trying to curtail birth-control access by sowing misinformation about how various methods work to prevent pregnancy, even as Republican leaders scramble to reassure voters they have no intention of restricting the right to contraception, which polls show the vast majority of Americans favor.

Democrats are seeking to capitalize on the moment, with the Senate scheduled to hold a vote Wednesday on the federal right to contraception.</description>

      <title>Correction: Lawmakers expensed millions in 2023 under a new program that doesn’t require receipts. An earlier alert incorrectly said Rep. Gaetz was the top spender.</title>
      <description>he program, which kicked off last year after a House panel passed it with bipartisan support, was intended to make it easier for lawmakers to cover the cost of maintaining separate residences in D.C. and their home districts. But critics argue that its reliance on the honor system and lack of transparent record-keeping makes it ripe for abuse.

An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) was the reimbursement program’s top spender in 2023. That analysis was based on data released by the House as of last week. But additional data The Post reviewed Tuesday showed that Rep. Jack Bergman (R-Mich.) was reimbursed for more than Gaetz was. This article has been updated and alert corrected.</description>

      <title>FDA panel recommends against approving MDMA to treat PTSD. It’s unclear whether the agency will authorize the novel treatment.</title>
      <description>Committee members said there is not enough evidence that use of the drug, also known as ecstasy, can be used safely and effectively. But the Food and Drug Administration sometimes sets aside recommendations of its advisory panels, so there’s still a chance the agency will approve the first-of-its kind application for a psychedelic drug.</description>
