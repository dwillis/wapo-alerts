      <title>Biden draws sharp contrasts with Trump in fiery State of the Union address</title>
      <description>In a speech befitting the political moment of an election year, President Biden loaded up on criticism of former president Donald Trump — without saying his name once. He dinged the Republican presidential front-runner for his coziness with Russia, the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and Trump’s failure in his “duty to care” during the pandemic.
He also enthusiastically mixed it up several times with Republicans in the chamber, and at times he seemed to encourage the call-and-response with them.</description>

      <title>Biden is failing at the most important task of his presidency, Perry Bacon Jr. writes</title>
      <description>Even Democrats who are skeptical of President Biden’s chances of winning this November usually say he is doing a fantastic job, pointing to the strong economy and the long list of legislation that has passed in his tenure. The implication is that voters aren’t appreciating Biden as they should, perhaps because of his age.</description>

      <title>Nikki Haley to suspend her presidential campaign, according to several people familiar with her plans</title>
      <description>The former U.N. ambassador is set to make the announcement this morning in South Carolina, according to several people familiar with her plans. The only woman in the Republican contest, Haley campaigned on her foreign policy experience and general election appeal, casting her candidacy as a generational change that could bring more voters into the party. But her message struggled to appeal to a base that overwhelmingly supports former president Donald Trump, who now stands as the presumptive nominee.</description>

      <title>Rep. Adam Schiff (D) and Steve Garvey (R) will move on to the general election for Senate seats in California, AP projects</title>
      <description>Schiff and Garvey were the top two vote-getters in California’s all-party primary and will now be on the ballot in November to replace the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D), the Associated Press projected. Schiff was also projected one of the top vote-getters in the special primary to fill out the remainder of Feinstein’s term.
Schiff faced two other Democratic House members after he scored some heavyweight endorsements and spent heavily on TV ads. Garvey, a former professional baseball player, didn’t run a single ad but may have benefitted from Schiff’s ads calling him “too conservative.” Schiff will be favored to win in the deep-blue state this fall.</description>

      <title>Mark Robinson, the controversial lieutenant governor endorsed by Trump, wins N.C. GOP gubernatorial nod, AP projects</title>
      <description>Robinson beat several other contenders for the open seat of outgoing Gov. Roy Cooper (D), the Associated Press reported. The race will be one of the most competitive gubernatorial contests in the country, as many say Robinson, the first Black person to hold the lieutenant governor post, is too extreme to win the state’s general election.

Robinson has mocked school shooting survivors, called Michelle Obama a man, insulted transgender people and used antisemitic tropes.</description>
