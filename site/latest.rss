      <title>Laura Loomer’s far-right rhetoric has repelled many would-be MAGA allies, with one notable exception: Trump himself</title>
      <description>People around the former president apparently see Loomer — an anti-Islam, anti-immigration activist — as a liability at a time when Donald Trump’s campaign (if not the candidate himself) is making a conscious effort to make their man appear less extreme, according to several sources close to the campaign’s inner circle. Still, Loomer is dead set on landing a role in a second Trump administration.</description>

      <title>Chris Pratt’s demolition of a historic home to build a modern farmhouse is part of a disturbing trend</title>
      <description>Few people realized the Zimmerman House in Los Angeles was in any danger before it was unceremoniously razed by the actor and his wife, author Katherine Schwarzenegger, who bought the mid-century home and its nearly one-acre plot last year for $12.5 million. Increasingly, preservationists say, these demos are not driven by changing tastes but rather by Americans’ ravenous appetites for larger and larger homes.</description>

      <title>The children who seem to remember past lives</title>
      <description>What happens when a toddler is haunted by memories that aren’t theirs? The phenomenon, with its aura of the paranormal, has long been fodder for books, academic studies and dramatized documentaries. But there is no scientific means to conclusively prove — or disprove — a mechanism that might explain how a person could recall living a past life.</description>

      <title>Canada arrests three men in killing of Sikh separatist, an official says; Trudeau linked killing to Indian government</title>
      <description>The three men are Indian Canadians believed to be part of an organized crime network acting on the behalf of the Indian government and its intelligence apparatus, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive law enforcement matter.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told lawmakers in September that authorities were pursuing “credible allegations” that agents of the Indian government were behind the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar last June in Surrey, British Columbia. Nijjar, a Canadian citizen, advocated for an autonomous Sikh state in India.</description>

      <description>The president called on pro-Palestinian demonstrators at campuses around the country to avoid chaos and intimidation, saying that Americans have a right to peaceful protest but strongly condemning some of the tactics that have been used. “We’ve all seen the images, and they put to the test two fundamental American principles,” Biden said in quickly scheduled remarks at the White House. “The first is the right to free speech and for people to peacefully assemble and make their voices heard. The second is the rule of law. Both must be upheld.”</description>

What unfolded reflects a broader struggle underway in education as some administrators turn to increasingly drastic measures to limit the reach of a technology that is both ubiquitous and endlessly distracting.</description>

      <title>GOP-led Arizona Senate votes to repeal Civil War-era abortion ban. The Democratic governor is expected to sign it into law.</title>
      <description>The state’s highest court revived the ban on nearly all abortions in early April and it was set to take effect in June. The repeal is expected to be signed into law by Gov. Katie Hobbs in the coming days, but the state attorney general’s office said the repeal would not take effect until 90 days after the legislature adjourns for the summer. So, barring successful court challenges, the 1864 ban could take effect for a short time in the state.</description>

      <title>A landmark study scared women away from menopause hormone treatments. A 20-year follow-up has found fears were largely overblown.</title>
      <description>A new analysis published in JAMA found that for many younger menopausal women — typically those under 60 — the benefits of the drugs probably outweigh the risks for the short-term treatment of menopause symptoms. The analysis shows that younger women starting menopause and experiencing symptoms can take hormone treatments for several years with a lower likelihood of adverse effects.</description>
