      <description>The approval rating of Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) among registered voters has risen seven percentage points since March, and he wins high marks for his response to the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll.

      <title>Hurricane Helene, now Category 2, likely to intensify before pummeling Florida and the Southeast. See forecasts and live updates.</title>
      <description>As the massive storm moves toward Florida’s Gulf Coast, its sheer size means dangerous tropical storm-force winds will reach hundreds of miles from the storm's center. The Big Bend area, where the state’s peninsula meets the Panhandle, could see rising water up to 20 feet. And some areas of the United States, including places well beyond Florida, could see over a foot of rain and threats of life-threatening flash-flooding.</description>
