      <description>The Russian president, who has defied term limits repeatedly since taking power on Dec. 31, 1999, will extend his rule to 2030. The vote drew protests in Russia and allegations of war crimes in occupied Ukraine, where ballots were cast at gunpoint.</description>

      <description>Sunday’s peak at the Tidal Basin tied with 2000 as the second-earliest on record; only the March 15, 1990, bloom came sooner in observations since 1921.

      <title>America’s stunning recovery from the covid crisis, in 11 charts</title>
      <description>Four years ago this week, the first wave of what would grow to be 20 million job losses set in, although most Americans were more terrified of catching a new, very transmissible and sometimes fatal virus. After a pandemic-fueled roller coaster, a new normal has settled into the U.S. economy — one that nobody could have predicted four years ago.</description>

      <title>How a sleuth defense attorney in the Trump Georgia case and a disgruntled former law partner seized on the Willis-Wade rumor</title>
      <description>When defense attorneys in the election interference case first heard the rumor that Fulton County District Attorney Fani T. Willis (D) had hired a lover to lead the case, the reaction was muted. It was early September, just three weeks after their clients had been indicted, and they were busy preparing their cases. But one lawyer was interested — and quickly started tracking down records.</description>

      <title>Former vice president Mike Pence says he will not endorse Donald Trump in 2024, in a remarkable break from tradition</title>
      <description>Pence served under Trump but has been critical of the former president following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol in which Pence was targeted by a mob of pro-Trump supporters. Pence rebuked his former boss in strong terms Friday, saying Trump’s agenda doesn't align with conservatives.
“Donald Trump is pursuing and articulating an agenda that is at odds with the conservative agenda that we governed on during our four years, and that is why I cannot in good conscience endorse Donald Trump in this campaign,” Pence told Fox News.</description>

      <title>Georgia judge orders District Attorney Fani Willis to step aside or remove top prosecutor in Trump election interference case</title>
      <description>In a ruling issued Friday, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee wrote that defendants “failed to meet their burden” in proving Willis’s relationship with lead prosecutor Nathan Wade was a “conflict of interest" enough to merit her removal from the case. But the judge also found an appearance of “impropriety” and said either Willis and her office must fully leave the case or Wade must withdraw from the proceeding.</description>

      <description>Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee’s ruling is likely to be a career-defining moment for the 34-year-old judge. His decision, whatever it is, will almost certainly be questioned because of its implications for the 2024 presidential election and is sure to draw political attacks in an already contentious election year in which he, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and former president Donald Trump will each be on the ballot.</description>

      <title>Correction: National Park Service to remove 140 cherry trees for D.C. sea wall project. A previous alert said 300.</title>
      <description>The removal of the iconic Japanese flowering trees between the Thomas Jefferson Memorial and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial will begin in May, the Park Service said.

In all, about 300 trees of different varieties, including cherry trees, will be removed from the Tidal Basin and West Potomac Park during a three-year project to rehabilitate crumbling sea walls in the area. When work is completed, the Park Service said, it will plant hundreds more trees.

An earlier version of this alert misstated the number of cherry trees that would be removed. This alert has been corrected.</description>

      <title>The House overwhelmingly passed a bill that could ban TikTok in the U.S. Its fate in the Senate is uncertain.</title>
