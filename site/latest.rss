      <title>A severe solar storm is hitting Earth. It could disrupt communications systems but show off the Northern Lights.</title>
      <description>The severe geomagnetic storm is the most intense in two decades and resulted from multiple solar eruptions that hurtled toward Earth. If the storm holds its strength, auroras could be seen with the naked eye at night as far south as Alabama and California.</description>

      <title>Netanyahu says Israel can ‘stand alone’ after Biden warning he could halt U.S. arms</title>
      <description>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was strong enough to fight alone after President Biden threatened to halt the shipment of U.S. offensive weapons if the country moves ahead with its long-planned ground invasion of Rafah in the Gaza Strip. “If we have to stand alone, we will stand alone,” Netanyahu said in a video message ahead of Israel’s Independence Day.</description>

      <description>The VA's inspector general has found that more than 180 senior executives received improper bonuses last fall, with several taking home more than $100,000. The bonuses came from money Congress had earmarked to recruit and retain specialists. VA executives have been ordered to repay the money, but some are challenging the ruling.</description>

      <title>Trump asked oil CEOs at Mar-a-Lago to raise $1 billion for his campaign, vowed to target EVs, say people who knew of meeting</title>
      <description>At a meeting last month at his Florida club, Donald Trump told some of the nation’s top oil executives they should invest in his presidential campaign instead of spending huge sums lobbying the Biden administration, according to people with knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation. Trump told the executives that if he returns to office, he would quickly reverse President Biden’s climate and energy policies. The result, Trump said, would be more offshore oil drilling, exports of liquified natural gas and support for gas-powered cars, instead of electric vehicles.</description>

      <title>President Biden says he will stop weapons shipments if Israel invades Rafah, the most direct threat he’s made since war started</title>
      <description>Biden said in an interview with CNN scheduled to air Wednesday that civilians in Gaza have been killed by U.S. weapons as Israel has gone after "population centers." Biden continued: "If they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically ... to deal with the cities." His acknowledgement that U.S. weapons have been used to kill civilians in Gaza and conditioning of support to the American ally is a notable change from his previous public comments on Israel's military operation.</description>

      <title>House overwhelmingly votes against ousting Speaker Mike Johnson, a blow to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s efforts to remove him</title>
      <description>Democrats voted with most Republicans in support of a procedural motion that effectively ends the attempt of Greene (R-Ga.) to topple Johnson (R-La.). That means the House will not consider a “motion to vacate,” which would have been a direct vote on Johnson’s leadership. The speaker will keep his job for now, but future ouster attempts are possible.</description>

      <title>U.S. paused shipments of thousands of bombs to Israel amid a rift over its battle plans for Rafah</title>
      <description>In an unprecedented move, the Biden administration paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs and other munitions bound for Israel last week as a result of mounting concern about the country’s plan to expand a military operation in southern Gaza that could dramatically increase the conflict’s death toll, senior administration officials said. It is the first known instance of a pause in U.S. arms transfers since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack. One U.S. official described the move as a “shot across the bow” intended to underscore the seriousness of Washington’s concerns.</description>

"You need to speak to him. I won’t tolerate that.”</description>

      <description>Judge Aileen M. Cannon canceled the May 20 start of Donald Trump's trial for allegedly withholding classified documents after leaving the White House and obstructing government efforts to get them back, saying she could not set a new date until myriad pre-trial issues are resolved. The decision increases the chances that Trump, who’s on trial in New York for allegedly falsifying business records connected to a hush money payment, will not face another criminal trial before the November presidential election in which he is the likely Republican nominee.</description>

Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records related to his reimbursement of his then-lawyer Michael Cohen for a hush money payment made to the adult-film actress shortly before the 2016 election, which was meant to keep her from publicly sharing her story.</description>
