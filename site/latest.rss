      <title>Biden relies on a little-known White House doctor who has never ordered a cognitive test for the president</title>
      <description>President Biden’s prime-time debate performance — where he mumbled, repeatedly misspoke and sometimes appeared confused — has put new scrutiny on the man that the president simply calls “Doc” and on his handling of the president’s health. Kevin O’Connor, the physician to the president, has grown extraordinarily close to Biden since becoming his personal doctor in 2009 but has kept a low profile in the job.</description>

      <title>This natural gas exporter is building a fortress on sinking land. Can its 26-foot-high wall protect it from sea level rise?</title>
      <description>In a part of Louisiana threatened by hurricanes and storm surge, a company has built a massive sea wall around its gas export plant.
That raises a question: How far will the fossil fuel industry go to protect itself from climate impacts it helped cause?</description>

      <title>Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) is seeking to assemble a group of senators to ask Biden to exit the presidential race</title>
      <description>Warner is telling Democratic senators that Biden can no longer stay in the election in the wake of his faltering debate performance, according to two people familiar with private conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely.
As the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, the Virginia Democrat is viewed as a serious voice privately advocating for the president to step aside. He represents a state that Democrats must win in November to maintain their hold on the White House.</description>

Viganò, who was loyal to the previous pope, Benedict XVI, had called on the pope to resign, be arrested, and excoriated him in harsh terms, including calling him “a servant of Satan.”</description>

      <title>Biden and aides concede he needs to quickly demonstrate his fitness for office or face pressure to step aside</title>
      <description>Growing concern from Capitol Hill, top donors and senior party strategists, including some of his own advisers, prompted Biden to start contacting allies in recent days to admit that he is in a tough moment and that he has to prove to voters he is up for the job.
His critics have been shaken by his relative inaction over the previous six days to directly address the panic ignited by his halting debate performance last Thursday.</description>

      <title>Trump’s N.Y. hush money sentencing is postponed until September, showing initial impact of Supreme Court immunity ruling</title>
      <description>The judge in Donald Trump's trial for falsifying records related to a hush money payment has pushed his sentencing back to September, just weeks before the November election, to give his lawyers time to argue that Monday's Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity means Trump's 34 felony convictions should be tossed out.</description>

      <title>Sen. Joe Manchin III threatened to break with Biden after the president’s debate performance before senior Democrats intervened</title>
      <description>The West Virginia senator intended to break with Biden on a Sunday news show, a high-profile defection that would have underscored Biden’s weakness had senior Democrats not helped dissuade Manchin from doing so. Manchin is an independent who caucuses with the Democrats and would have been the first elected official allied with Democrats to break with Biden. On Tuesday, however, Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.) became the first sitting House member to urge Biden to step aside, saying in a statement that “too much is at stake to risk a Trump victory.”</description>

      <title>Rudy Giuliani disbarred in New York for efforts to overturn 2020 election</title>
      <description>A state appeals court found that Giuliani, as a personal attorney to former president Donald Trump, “flagrantly misused his prominent position.” The panel said that Giuliani, a former prosecutor and former mayor of New York, repeatedly made false statements to courts and lawmakers about the election and that he “baselessly attacked and undermined the integrity of this country’s electoral process.”</description>

      <title>Donald Trump’s July 11 sentencing in N.Y. hush money case may be postponed in light of Supreme Court immunity ruling</title>
      <description>The former president asked a judge to postpone the sentencing for his 34 felony convictions, arguing that Monday’s Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity could invalidate some of the evidence used in the Manhattan trial this spring. On Tuesday, the Manhattan district attorney told the judge he would not oppose a delay in sentencing, increasing the likelihood the July 11 sentencing date will be pushed back.</description>
