      <title>Larry Summers is stepping back from public commitments over Jeffrey Epstein emails, saying he is ‘deeply ashamed’</title>
      <description>“I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,” Summers said in a statement. It was unclear whether the Democratic former treasury secretary would exit a wide array of boards and think tanks or if those organizations would cut ties with him. Summers is also a former president of Harvard University, where he still holds a professorship.</description>

      <title>Trump says he won’t rule out sending troops into Venezuela, despite his claim that U.S. may be open to talks with Maduro</title>
      <description>“I don’t rule out anything, we just have to take care of Venezuela,” President Donald Trump said when asked at a news conference about putting American personnel “on the ground.” His remarks appeared startlingly at odds with his claim Sunday night that the administration “may be having some discussions” with Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s strongman president.</description>

      <title>A Trump loyalist prosecutor is probing former top Obama administration officials</title>
      <description>Jason Reding Quiñones's appointment to lead an office he left last year after poor performance reviews is a case study in how the administration is operating U.S. attorney’s offices across the country, plucking Trump backers with little support from staffers to serve in high-powered positions, according to people familiar with the Justice Department’s operations. 

In several cases, including Reding Quiñones’s, the appointments have led to a staff exodus and a sharp drop in morale as the appointees embrace the administration’s most controversial investigations.</description>

      <title>New foreign student enrollment at U.S. colleges dropped 17 percent in the fall</title>
      <description>The Trump administration has thrown up barriers to student visas, and experts expect a continued decline as many international students decide to study in other countries. The number applying to U.S. colleges for next year has dropped 9 percent so far, according to preliminary data. Some advocates argue the decline will hurt the U.S. economy because immigrants often play a key role in business start-ups and research.</description>
