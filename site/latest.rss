      <title>An earlier alert incorrectly concluded a court filing had said a DOGE member fulfilled an agreement to share Social Security data to overturn elections</title>
      <description>The Justice Department submitted a court filing Friday in an ongoing case saying that the Social Security Administration had discovered a secret agreement between a DOGE employee and an unidentified political advocacy group. The agreement called for sharing Social Security data with the aim of overturning election results in certain states, according to the filing. An earlier alert failed to acknowledge, the agency learned of the agreement in November, according to the court filing, but had “not yet seen evidence that SSA data were shared with the advocacy group.”</description>
