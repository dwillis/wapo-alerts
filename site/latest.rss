      <title>Arizona prosecutors haven't been able to serve Rudy Giuliani his indictment</title>
      <description>Nearly three weeks ago, the former New York mayor was charged in Arizona in connection with actions he allegedly took after the 2020 presidential election to try to reverse Donald Trump's loss in the state. Two state attorney general agents traveled to New York to hand-deliver a summons to Giuliani but weren't able to get past a doorman. Other attempts have also failed. If Giuliani doesn't appear in court on May 21, he could be held in contempt.</description>

      <title>Joe Biden nearly died after a misdiagnosis decades ago. His surgeon recounts saving his life.</title>
      <description>Biden woke up fully clothed on a hotel room floor in 1988 with an excruciating pain in his head — the signs of a burst brain aneurysm. Only a risky, 100-mile journey to D.C. and then hours of brain surgery saved his life. As voters now question the 81-year-old’s health, doctors say the episode carries little long-term risk, although the near miss changed his life.</description>

      <title>U.S. threats led to a rupture of vital military ties in West Africa, Nigerien leader says</title>
      <description>In an exclusive interview, Nigerien Prime Minister Ali Mahaman Lamine Zeine blamed the United States for the breakdown in bilateral relations, culminating with the planned ouster of more than 1,000 American troops. Before a military coup in Niger last year, the country had been the United States’ closest ally in West Africa, and the operation of a massive U.S. drone base there had been central to efforts at containing a mounting insurgency by Islamist extremists across the region.</description>

      <description>Donald Trump’s former lawyer and fixer is back on the witness stand after telling jurors before a lunch break that the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels was an effort to keep her quiet as Trump ran for president in 2016.

Bowser’s overall job performance, a decrease from 58 percent in a 2022 Post-Schar School poll and 67 percent in both 2019 and 2017. Residents continue to give her negative marks for her efforts to reduce crime while growing increasingly critical of her handling of other major issues, like addressing homelessness and improving the city’s public schools.</description>

      <description>The delayed response prolonged an April 30 attack on a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus, one of the most violent altercations during this spring’s wave of campus protests. A Washington Post examination — based on more than 200 videos, emergency radio transmissions and other evidence — found that more than a dozen people were visibly injured before police stepped in. The Post also found that faculty had raised concerns for days about verbal and physical harassment directed at protesters, raising questions about whether the school should have had more police on hand to prevent an altercation.</description>
