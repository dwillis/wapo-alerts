      <title>A narco revolt takes a once-peaceful nation to the brink</title>
      <description>Ecuador’s young president declared war on the country’s powerful drug gangs after they sparked a wave of violence, including killings, kidnappings and car bombs. The Post has reconstructed the day Ecuador nearly collapsed when organized-crime groups, which have vastly expanded their influence across Latin America, launched attacks on the police, seized a TV station and rioted in prisons.</description>

      <title>What O.J. Simpson and his murder trial told us about race in America</title>
      <description>The nation’s view of Simpson's 1995 acquittal in the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and a friend, Ronald Goldman, largely fell along racial lines, though time has bridged some of the gap.</description>

      <title>Women in states with bans often take abortion pills alone and afraid. They share their experiences.</title>
      <description>Overwhelming evidence shows that taking abortion pills is safe and effective. But as more women in states where abortion is illegal choose to end their pregnancies on their own, without directly interacting with a medical professional, they are thrust into a largely ad hoc, unregulated system of online and grass-roots abortion pill distributors. The experience can be confusing, scary and, at times, deeply traumatic.</description>

      <title>Longest-serving liberal on Wisconsin Supreme Court won’t run again, potentially upending swing-state court after $50 million race</title>
      <description>Justice Ann Walsh Bradley’s retirement gives conservatives their last chance in the coming years to win a majority after losing last year’s race, the most expensive judicial contest in U.S. history. The court with 4-3 votes upheld Joe Biden’s win and ended a GOP gerrymander. It could soon decide whether abortion remains legal.</description>

      <title>O.J. Simpson dies at 76. His murder trial led the former NFL star to become a symbol of domestic violence and racial division.</title>
      <description>Simpson died of cancer on Wednesday, his family announced on X. In a trial that riveted the nation, Simpson was found not guilty in 1995 of murdering his ex-wife and her friend, though he was later found liable in a civil judgment. He spent years in jail on unrelated charges — a stunning downfall for a man who had risen from a San Francisco slum to become one of the greatest running backs in football history, an actor in more than 20 movies, a corporate pitchman and a TV sports commentator.</description>

      <description>A special grand jury report alleged that the boy was not supposed to be attending the school after an incident in which he choked a teacher, but lapses by administrators allowed him back on campus.

      <title>What we know about China’s alleged election interference in Canada as Trudeau testifies in public inquiry</title>
      <description>China sought to “clandestinely and deceptively” influence Canada’s federal elections in 2019 and 2021 with the aim of electing candidates that could further — or at least not oppose — Beijing’s strategic interests, according to Canadian intelligence reports introduced as evidence in a public inquiry.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had long resisted calls to launch a public inquiry into claims that China interfered in Canada’s elections and has defended his government’s response to the threat of foreign interference. The Canadian leader, who is testifying before the commission today, has said there’s no evidence the results of the elections were compromised.</description>

But he has made significant inroads in convincing Republicans that his lies are the truth. That applies to election integrity especially — the basis of Trump’s “big lie.”</description>
