      <title>ICE memo outlines plan to deport migrants to countries where they are not citizens</title>
      <description>Federal immigration officers may deport immigrants with as little as six hours’ notice to countries other than their own even if officials have not provided any assurances that the new arrivals will be safe from persecution or torture, a top official said in a memo this week. The dramatic shift in policy could result in thousands of people being sent to places where they lack family ties or even a common language.</description>
