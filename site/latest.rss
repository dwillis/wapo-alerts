      <title>The average U.S. hurricane leads to more than 10,000 indirect deaths in the years after it makes landfall, study finds</title>
      <description>An analysis of U.S. hurricane data released Wednesday found that the average tropical cyclone leads to thousands of excess fatalities for more than a decade after it makes landfall. The finding — which is hundreds of times higher than official death estimates — highlights how communities are left poorer, sicker and more isolated years after the floodwaters recede.</description>

The lawsuits would exponentially increase the number of sexual abuse accusations against the music producer. Combs is being held at a Brooklyn jail on federal charges of racketeering and sexual trafficking.</description>

      <description>Before this scenic, rustic Great Smoky Mountain refuge turned into a trap many didn't see coming, there were signs of Hurricane Helene’s unthinkable potential. Many said the torrential rains and flash floods — which have claimed an untold number of lives — caught them unprepared. Now Helene, one Haywood County official said, could “change how we think about storms in the mountains.”</description>

      <title>Pete Rose dies at 83. The Cincinnati Reds star awed fans but was banished from baseball after gambling on his team as manager.</title>
      <description>Known as “Charlie Hustle” for his aggressive style of play, Rose won two World Series titles with his hometown team on his path to breaking the all-time hits record.
In 1989, reports surfaced that he was deep in debt from gambling. Major League Baseball’s commissioner’s office released a report that year with testimony from Rose’s bookies that he bet on baseball — including the Reds, while he was managing the team — during the 1985, ’86 and ’87 seasons. He was banished from the game and excluded from the Hall of Fame.</description>

      <description>In 1974, a dozen friends wore morning coats and floor-length dresses, dined on oysters, drank champagne and danced together as a string quartet played in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial. The extravagant scene drew in a Washington Post photographer, who captured the moment in a mysterious image that would ricochet around the country in newspaper reprints.
A year ago, the daughter of that photographer met one of the participants and began to put the pieces together.</description>
