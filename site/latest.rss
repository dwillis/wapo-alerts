      <title>Marian Robinson, mother of former first lady Michelle Obama, dies at 86</title>
      <description>A homemaker from the South Side of Chicago, she became the first presidential in-law in generations to live in the White House. On election night in 2008, Barack Obama described his mother-in-law as having been uncharacteristically emotional as she witnessed his historic election as the first Black president of the United States.
“She was sitting next to me, actually, as we were watching returns. And she’s like my grandmother was, sort of a no-fuss type of person. And suddenly, she just kind of reached out and she started holding my hand, you know, kind of squeezing it,” he said in an interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes.”</description>

      <description>As AI-generated images spread across entertainment, social media and other industries that shape cultural norms, The Washington Post set out to understand how this technology defines one of society’s most indelible standards: female beauty. Using dozens of prompts on three of the leading image tools — MidJourney, DALL-E and Stable Diffusion — The Post found that AI steers users toward a startlingly narrow vision of attractiveness.</description>

      <title>Will Donald Trump go to jail? Can he be president? Here’s what happens next after the guilty verdict in the hush money case.</title>
      <description>Trump was convicted on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in his New York state hush money case. A 12-person jury unanimously agreed on the verdict after deliberating for several hours over two days, finding that Trump falsified records to cover up $130,000 in payments before the 2016 election to an adult-film actress to keep her quiet about an alleged sexual encounter with him years earlier.</description>

Pressure from European officials and a recent visit to Kyiv by Secretary of State Antony Blinken have underscored for the White House the peril facing Ukraine at this point in the war.</description>

      <title>The jury has reached a decision in Donald Trump's hush money trial. Follow our coverage as the verdict is read.</title>
      <description>Trump, his lawyers and Manhattan prosecutors have been summoned back to the courtroom to hear whether the jury has reached a unanimous decision to convict or acquit the only former U.S. president ever charged with a crime. If jurors were divided over whether Trump falsified business records related to a hush money payment in an effort to impact the 2016 election, the judge will declare a mistrial — and prosecutors will have to decide whether to retry the case.</description>

      <title>TikTok offered an extraordinary deal to give the White House control over its American operations. The U.S. took a pass.</title>
      <description>In 2022, TikTok offered the Biden administration control over the app’s U.S. operations, including a nationwide kill switch and the right to veto its hiring in the United States. The administration said no, a decision that set in motion an uncertain legal battle that could either solidify the app's First Amendment protections or lead to the potential ban of a service used by 170 million across the country.</description>

      <title>Alito says he will not recuse from Jan. 6 cases, offers new details on politically charged flags raised at his homes</title>
      <description>Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. faced calls from Democratic lawmakers and some legal experts to recuse from two Supreme Court cases related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election results after reports that an upside-down American flag and a religious flag — both of which have been embraced by election deniers — flew outside the homes owned by him and his wife. Alito said his wife is “fond of flying flags” and was responsible for the raising of these flags. He also said he asked her to lower the upside-down American flag but she initially refused to do so.</description>
