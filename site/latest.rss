      <description>President-elect Donald Trump had tapped Chad Chronister to lead the agency grappling with a drug crisis fueled by the flow of illicit fentanyl. On Tuesday, Chronister said on social media that “as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I’ve concluded that I must respectfully withdraw from consideration.”

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky) was among a group of conservative voices who pushed back against Chronister's selection, criticizing his enforcement of public health orders during the pandemic.</description>

      <title>Trump’s lawyers point to Hunter Biden pardon in seeking dismissal of N.Y. hush money case</title>
      <description>President-elect Donald Trump’s felony conviction for falsifying business documents is tainted by the same corruption in the justice system that President Joe Biden decried when he announced his son’s pardon, Trump’s attorneys wrote in a document released Tuesday. The attorneys pointed to comments by Biden in defending his pardon of his son. Biden signed a pardon Sunday for Hunter Biden, who was found guilty of gun-related charges in Delaware and pleaded guilty to tax evasion in California.</description>

      <title>A year of Israeli soldiers’ videos highlights the willful destruction of Gaza</title>
      <description>The Post verified more than 120 photos and videos of the war in Gaza, most of which were recorded by soldiers or posted on their social media accounts.
