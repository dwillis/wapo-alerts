      <title>Analysis: Biden’s rough night, Trump’s false claims, and other takeaways from the first 2024 presidential debate</title>
      <description>The president’s performance did nothing to allay fears about his age, though he got some rare traction on Jan. 6 and Trump’s legal problems. And the former president finally took a position on an abortion question.</description>

      <title>Former Uvalde school district police chief indicted in connection with botched response to 2022 mass shooting</title>
      <description>The Texas attack was one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history. The 18-year-old gunman who stormed the school in May 2022 killed 19 students and two teachers before officers eventually shot him. In January, the Justice Department issued a scathing 575-page report that criticized local police commanders and state law enforcement for their actions that day.</description>

      <title>Los Angeles Lakers select Bronny James in second round of NBA draft, setting him up to be teammates with his father, LeBron</title>
      <description>The 19-year-old James was drafted Thursday despite a middling freshman season at Southern Cal, where he played after suffering cardiac arrest last summer. LeBron James can become a free agent this offseason, but the 39-year-old Lakers star has long expressed a desire to play with Bronny as the NBA's first father-son duo.</description>

      <title>Supreme Court temporarily protects access to emergency abortions in Idaho, despite the state’s ban</title>
      <description>The Biden administration argued that Idaho’s strict abortion ban conflicts with federal law requiring hospitals to provide emergency medical care, including abortion, for non-fatal but threatening health conditions such as organ failure or loss of fertility. The court's ruling was accidentally posted on its website a day early but was not official until it was announced Thursday.</description>

      <description>The fight, involving the maker of Oxycontin, has bitterly divided victims of the opioid crisis. Some said the settlement is the best and only way to get urgently needed funds for recovery and treatment, while others say it is unacceptable that a family blamed for helping ignite the opioid epidemic could escape additional responsibility in civil courts.</description>

      <description>The immigration debate in the United States generally revolves around illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border, but those numbers don’t indicate what happens to these and other migrants who stay in the country. A Washington Post analysis of U.S. immigration court records from the past decade reveals a population that has fanned out into every state.</description>

      <title>Supreme Court opinion posted prematurely shows the justices would allow emergency abortions in Idaho despite state’s strict ban</title>
      <description>The Supreme Court would allow emergency abortion care to prevent infertility, organ failure or other non-fatal health conditions, despite the state’s restrictions on the procedure, according to Bloomberg Law, which viewed a copy of a not-yet-released opinion that was briefly posted on the court’s website. It is extremely rare — perhaps unprecedented — for a ruling to be posted before the Supreme Court issues it. The opinion would be at least a temporary victory for the Biden administration, which has struggled to protect abortion access since the high court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago.</description>

      <description>The railway and its contractors disregarded signs that the train’s derailed tank cars posed little risk of exploding, yet went ahead with the venting and burning of toxic vinyl chloride, investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board said. The burn-off sent a towering black cloud of toxic fumes into the air following the accident, spreading contamination over a vast area. In addition, Norfolk Southern failed to communicate adequately with incident commanders, a decision that was unjustified, investigators said.</description>
