      <title>Trump announces release of Marc Fogel, an American imprisoned in Russia, as part of deal with Kremlin</title>
      <description>As a result of the deal, Fogel has been released and is returning to the United States, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz said in a statement. Fogel was detained by Russian officials in August 2021 and charged with smuggling into the country a small amount of medical marijuana, which was prescribed in the United States for back pain but is banned in Russia. Waltz called the deal with Russia an “exchange” but provided no information on what the United States offered in return. It was negotiated by President Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, he said.</description>

      <title>Israel will end Gaza ceasefire if Hamas does not return hostages Saturday, Netanyahu says</title>
      <description>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an address Tuesday that Israel would "gather forces inside and around the Gaza Strip" in preparation to resume war if hostages held by Hamas are not returned Saturday. It was not immediately clear if he meant the three hostages whose release had been agreed on or all remaining hostages.

Hamas said Monday it would delay the release over accusations of Israeli ceasefire violations. Netanyahu's remarks come after President Donald Trump said "all hell is going to break out" if hostages are not released.</description>

      <title>Justice Department tells prosecutors to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams</title>
      <description>Adams was indicted in September for allegedly accepting bribes through campaign donations and luxury travel perks. President Donald Trump has expressed sympathy for the mayor even as many officials and residents in New York said the charges made Adams unfit for office. The Justice Department said the case should be dropped because Adams is seeking reelection and should focus on fighting crime and illegal immigration.</description>

      <title>Trump says Palestinians would not have the right to return to Gaza under his proposal to take over the enclave</title>
      <description>In an interview with Fox News, President Donald Trump said “no” when asked whether Palestinians displaced by his plan to “own” the territory would be allowed to come back.

“No, they wouldn’t because they’re going to have much better housing,” he said in a clip of the interview that aired Monday, adding that he would “make a deal” with Egypt and Jordan to build “a permanent place” for Palestinians in those countries. American allies in the Middle East have angrily rejected Trump’s proposal, and the United Nations and legal experts say it probably violates international law.</description>

      <description>On Sunday night at the Super Bowl, Mahomes’s inevitability collided with a ferocious, profoundly talented defense. The Philadelphia Eagles clobbered the Kansas City Chiefs, 40-22, and bullied Mahomes into a brand of turnover-streaked, almost helpless football that had been foreign to him.</description>
