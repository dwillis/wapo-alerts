      <title>Israel is preparing soldiers for a possible ground maneuver in Lebanon, IDF chief tells troops</title>
      <description>Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, told soldiers to prepare for a possible entry to Lebanon, where they would “go in, destroy the enemy there and decisively destroy” Hezbollah’s infrastructure. Israel has called up two reservist brigades, it announced Wednesday, as it continued to strike targets it said were linked to Hezbollah, and the Lebanese group launched its own aerial attacks on Israel.</description>

In addition to a “life-threatening” storm surge that could reach up to 15 feet in the Big Bend area and up to 8 feet in Tampa, the National Hurricane Center is warning that several major cities — including Tampa, Orlando, Ocala and Jacksonville — could experience tropical-storm-force winds.</description>

      <description>Williams denied killing former St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter Felicia “Licia” Gayle in 1998, a murder for which he was convicted. Prosecutors and then-Gov. Eric Greitens (R) worked to stop his execution in the past decade, but Gov. Mike Parson (R) insisted that Williams, 55, be put to death.</description>

      <title>Alleged Trump golf course gunman charged with attempted assassination of a political candidate</title>
      <description>Ryan Routh, who was initially charged with two gun violations, now faces a total of five counts and a potential sentence of life in prison. He was arrested Sept. 15 after a U.S. Secret Service agent saw a rifle poking through the bushes near where former president and 2024 Republican nominee Donald Trump was playing golf. On Monday, prosecutors said Routh allegedly left a note with a friend months ago admitting to an attempted assassination of Trump.</description>

      <title>Trump-backed effort to change how Nebraska allocates electoral votes hits roadblock after a GOP state lawmaker’s comments</title>
      <description>Republican state Sen. Mike McDonnell said Monday he does not support changing how the state awards its electoral votes before the November election, imperiling a last-ditch push by former president Donald Trump and his GOP allies.
Nebraska is one of two states that partly awards its electoral votes by congressional district. That allowed Joe Biden to pick up an electoral vote in the solidly red state in 2020 by carrying the vote in a competitive House district in the Omaha area.</description>

      <title>Suspected Trump golf-course gunman left note saying, ‘This was an assassination attempt,’ according to court filing by prosecutors</title>
      <description>The man arrested with a rifle near where Donald Trump was playing golf this month left a note to a friend saying, “This was an assassination attempt,” according to a new court filing on Monday, shortly before Ryan Routh is expected to appear for a hearing. Routh has been held on gun charges after the Sept. 15 incident, in which authorities say he was spotted and fired upon by a Secret Service agent before he could see Trump or fire a shot. The note offers specific evidence suggesting that Routh’s intention was to kill the former president.</description>

      <title>Lebanon says at least 100 killed, 400 wounded as Israel launches ‘extensive’ strikes on Hezbollah</title>
      <description>Israel said it struck 300 targets in Lebanon on Monday as a military spokesman warned of “extensive, precise” strikes against Hezbollah and called for civilians to evacuate or move away from areas in which the militant group operates.

Lebanon’s Health Ministry said at least 100 people were killed and more than 400 wounded, making Monday the deadliest day in Lebanon since Israel and Hezbollah started trading strikes last October. Its count did not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but it said that children, women and paramedics were among those wounded or killed.</description>
