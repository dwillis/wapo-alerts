Their findings suggest tiny changes in brain chemistry could trigger behavioral change that sets us apart from Neanderthals.</description>

      <title>In beloved national parks, deep concern among Americans of all political persuasions</title>
      <description>To see how the parks are faring amid the turmoil of the federal government’s downsizing, Washington Post reporters visited four locations just before peak summer season. We found that changes so far were subtle, though staff members cautioned that issues might emerge in coming months. We also found profound affection for America’s “crown jewels” — as the national parks have historically been described — strong support for their protection, and vivid concern over what budget and staffing cuts will mean in the years to come.</description>
