      <title>The U.S. bought $12 million in contraceptives and HIV medications for poor nations. Under Trump, the supplies may be destroyed.</title>
      <description>Aid organizations have been in talks about taking control of the supplies, but those negotiations have stalled amid shifting directives from the government, including demands that the groups pay for the materials and that any USAID labeling be removed, a Post examination found.

      <title>Trump orders investigation into alleged cover-up of Biden’s decline</title>
      <description>The unprecedented action accuses Biden aides of concealing what the president claims is his predecessor’s cognitive decline. The order focuses on the use of an autopen to sign hundreds of executive actions and directs White House counsel, with help from Attorney General Pam Bondi, to conduct the investigation.
In a statement Wednesday, the former president dismissed the allegations, saying: “I made the decisions during my presidency. ... Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.”</description>
