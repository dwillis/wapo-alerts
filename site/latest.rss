      <title>Some people can’t stop worrying that everything that happens is good for Trump</title>
      <description>Most people recognize that getting convicted of felonies is bad. But try telling that to nervous anti-Trumpers who think the former president will benefit from each of his would-be catastrophes.</description>

      <title>Where 4.1 million immigrants in the U.S. came from and where they live now</title>
      <description>The immigration debate in the United States generally revolves around illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border, but those numbers don’t indicate what happens to these and other migrants who stay in the country.

      <title>Supreme Court opinion posted prematurely shows the justices would allow emergency abortions in Idaho despite state’s strict ban</title>
      <description>The Supreme Court would allow emergency abortion care to prevent infertility, organ failure or other non-fatal health conditions, despite the state’s restrictions on the procedure, according to Bloomberg Law, which viewed a copy of a not-yet-released opinion that was briefly posted on the court’s website. It is extremely rare — perhaps unprecedented — for a ruling to be posted before the Supreme Court issues it. The opinion would be at least a temporary victory for the Biden administration, which has struggled to protect abortion access since the high court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago.</description>

      <title>Norfolk Southern’s decision to burn off toxic chemicals in Ohio derailment was unnecessary, NTSB investigators say</title>
      <description>The railway and its contractors disregarded signs that the train’s derailed tank cars posed little risk of exploding, yet went ahead with the venting and burning of toxic vinyl chloride, investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board said. The burn-off sent a towering black cloud of toxic fumes into the air following the accident, spreading contamination over a vast area. In addition, Norfolk Southern failed to communicate adequately with incident commanders, a decision that was unjustified, investigators said.</description>

      <title>Big Tobacco courts Black and LGBTQ+ activists to help loosen vaping regulations and fight menthol cigarette ban</title>
