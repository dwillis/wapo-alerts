      <description>There have been no documented cases of one human passing avian influenza to another, and researchers stress that other barriers remain before a mutated virus could be transmitted in that way.

      <title>Memphis police engage in excessive force, discriminate against Black and disabled people, Justice Dept. says</title>
      <description>In a scathing 73-page report, federal authorities said they had identified a pattern of unlawful conduct, including serious problems in the way officers handle traffic stops and deal with children, as well as deficiencies in training, policies and accountability for officers accused of misconduct.
The report comes nearly two years after Memphis police officers on a specialized street crime unit brutally beat Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, after a traffic stop, injuries that resulted in his death three days later.</description>
