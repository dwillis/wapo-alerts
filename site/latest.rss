      <title>Senate passes standalone bill to avert a $1 billion hit to the D.C. budget in GOP's continuing resolution</title>
      <description>The bill — led by Sens. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) — must go back to the House for approval, and it is unclear whether Republicans there will support it. If it does not pass the House, the district must still contend with what's expected to be more than $1 billion in budget cuts, which city officials have warned could impact every corner of the D.C. government.</description>

Schumer said Thursday that he plans to support the Republicans’ funding bill — but he is likely to need seven other Democrats to overcome a filibuster.

      <title>Alan Simpson dies at 93. The three-term Republican senator from Wyoming was a leading deficit hawk with a barbed and feisty wit.</title>
      <description>Simpson was first elected in 1978 and served 10 years as the GOP whip. He had an unrivaled talent for leavening dry policy discussions with evocative aphorisms (“don’t squat with your spurs on” was one favorite) and was known for pushing the 1986 immigration reform bill through a reluctant Congress.</description>

      <description>Judges have halted President Donald Trump's effort to ban citizenship for babies born in the United States to parents who are undocumented immigrants or in the country on temporary visas, with several issuing orders that apply nationwide.
