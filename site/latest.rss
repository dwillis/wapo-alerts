      <description>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump came to Montezuma Canyon in Arizona on Thursday to heap praise on “the Rolls-Royce of walls,” as he called it.

It’s technically impressive but utterly arbitrary, Washington Post art critic Sebastian Smee writes. But at least the whole bit is self-aware?</description>

      <title>Traffic fatalities have doubled since D.C.’s promise of zero</title>
      <description>Before she became mayor, Muriel E. Bowser (D) pledged to eliminate traffic deaths and serious injuries in D.C. by 2024. The city has relied heavily on camera enforcement, but a Washington Post analysis shows nine people have died this year within 250 feet of a camera. And an analysis of city traffic data shows that D.C. is on track this year to match last year’s 52 traffic deaths, which marked a 16-year high. Experts say the city has failed to make the necessary changes to major roads that would slow traffic.</description>

      <title>Analysis: Kamala Harris has put Trump in a box, and he’s struggling to break out, chief correspondent Dan Balz writes</title>
      <description>Democrats concluded their electrifying national convention Thursday night with Harris as the main event, delivering an address sculpted to keep her on the crest of a wave that has changed the contours of the presidential election. As the campaign now moves to its next phase, the focus on Donald Trump and how he attempts to regain his balance will be as much or more of the story compared with how Harris navigates the road ahead.</description>
