      <title>Senate hopeful Larry Hogan (R) has double-digit lead on Democrats in deep-blue Maryland, poll finds, with control of chamber in play</title>
      <description>A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll finds the former governor ahead of potential Democratic rivals, who face each other for the open seat on May 14. In that wide-open primary contest, the poll found Rep. David Trone with a slight lead over Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrook, with 39 percent of primary voters undecided. While Hogan leads now, Maryland voters said by a 20-point margin they prefer Democratic control of the Senate, a position Democrats plan to exploit to weaken Hogan's popularity.</description>

      <description>Footage recovered from the drone of an Al Jazeera team killed by the Israel Defense Forces in a targeted Jan. 7 missile strike raises critical questions about the Israeli justification for the attack. Hamza Dahdouh and Mustafa Thuraya are among 90 journalists and other media workers who have been killed in less than six months of fighting in Gaza, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists — the deadliest period for the profession since the group began collecting data in 1992.</description>
