      <title>Democratic-backed Susan Crawford is projected to win Wisconsin Supreme Court race that attracted Musk, Soros and other big names</title>
      <description>According to an Associated Press projection, Crawford defeated Brad Schimel, a Waukesha County judge and former Republican state attorney general, in the most expensive judicial race in U.S. history. The win by Crawford, a Dane County judge, ensures the court will maintain a liberal majority ahead of its expected consideration of cases on key issues, including reproductive rights.
Elon Musk and his affiliated groups invested more than $20 million to support Schimel. Crawford’s campaign benefited from large donations to the state Democratic Party from liberal billionaires, including Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, George Soros and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.</description>

Fine’s opponent had fundraised millions more in a race that was expected to be an early indicator of President Donald Trump’s second-term popularity. It also helps reinforce House Republicans’ narrow majority as they look to enact Trump’s agenda.</description>
