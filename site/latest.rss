      <title>Georgia enacts Russian-style ‘foreign agent’ law despite mass protests — a victory for Moscow</title>
      <description>The Georgian Dream party overrode a presidential veto, so now the law — which critics warn will be used to restrict free speech and squash political dissent — will pass. Georgia’s future as being part of either Moscow’s orbit or that of Western Europe hangs in the balance.</description>

      <title>Hunters killed off most of Florida’s wild flamingos. Now the fluorescent fowl appears to be making a comeback.</title>
      <description>Few animals are more closely associated with Florida’s iconography than the flamingo, but its numbers plummeted by the 1920s. Then Hurricane Idalia blew in several flamboyant flocks last year. Scientists feared they might fly back home, but a new Audubon Florida survey indicates they could be planning to stay.</description>

      <title>Small tortilla shops are being shaken down as Mexican cartels create vast extortion networks, expanding their grip on the economy</title>
      <description>At least 15 percent of tortillerías in Mexico — about 20,000 storefront businesses — are regularly extorted, according to the industry trade group. A decade ago only a tiny percentage were threatened.

Now he is breaking the orchestra world’s “code of silence” about hiring, firing and promotion to share his grievances. Symphony officials deny he was unfairly treated. But other musicians say he has launched a much-needed conversation about an outdated system they believe thwarts many talented young artists.</description>

      <description>College Court Apartments residents, exasperated by the problems in their building, proposed solutions to local leaders. Instead of a response, tenants awoke a few days later to find a padlock on the gate to the patio. Recent polling suggests low-income Black voters like the ones at College Court are disappointed in Joe Biden’s presidency — but he desperately needs their votes, especially in swing states such as Wisconsin.</description>

      <title>Three missionaries were killed by a gang in Haiti, an Oklahoma-based group says. Two were relatives of a Missouri lawmaker.</title>
      <description>Missouri state Rep. Ben Baker identified two of the victims as his daughter Natalie and son-in-law Davy Lloyd. They were coming out of a church Thursday evening when they were ambushed by “a gang of 3 trucks full of guys,” Missions in Haiti Inc. said on its Facebook page. A U.N.-approved international police force, led by Kenya and funded and trained largely by the United States, is preparing to deploy to the Caribbean nation to help its security forces confront gangs that now control an estimated 80 percent of the capital.</description>

      <title>The U.N.’s top court rules that Israel must ‘immediately halt’ its military offensive in Rafah</title>
      <description>International Court of Justice rulings are legally binding but require the U.N. Security Council to enforce them. Israel’s war to destroy Hamas in the Gaza Strip has leveled large sections of the territory, killed tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians, and brought the population to the brink of famine, according to health officials. In a preliminary response to the case filed by South Africa, the ICJ in January ordered provisional measures to prevent further harm to civilians.</description>
