It’s technically impressive but utterly arbitrary, Washington Post art critic Sebastian Smee writes. But at least the whole bit is self-aware?</description>

      <title>Traffic fatalities have doubled since D.C.’s promise of zero</title>
      <description>Before she became mayor, Muriel E. Bowser (D) pledged to eliminate traffic deaths and serious injuries in D.C. by 2024. The city has relied heavily on camera enforcement, but a Washington Post analysis shows nine people have died this year within 250 feet of a camera. And an analysis of city traffic data shows that D.C. is on track this year to match last year’s 52 traffic deaths, which marked a 16-year high. Experts say the city has failed to make the necessary changes to major roads that would slow traffic.</description>

      <title>Analysis: Kamala Harris has put Trump in a box, and he’s struggling to break out, chief correspondent Dan Balz writes</title>
      <description>Democrats concluded their electrifying national convention Thursday night with Harris as the main event, delivering an address sculpted to keep her on the crest of a wave that has changed the contours of the presidential election. As the campaign now moves to its next phase, the focus on Donald Trump and how he attempts to regain his balance will be as much or more of the story compared with how Harris navigates the road ahead.</description>

      <title>Kamala Harris to close out Democratic convention just weeks after ascending to the top of the ticket. Follow our live coverage.</title>
      <description>The vice president is set to give the keynote address on the fourth and final day of the DNC convention. She will formally accept the nomination a month after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed Harris to take his place. Also expected to speak tonight are Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and former congressman Adam Kinzinger, one of two Republicans on the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.</description>

      <title>Kamala Harris’s energized rallies mark a sharp contrast to her often-stumbling appearances of four years ago. That’s no accident.</title>
      <description>Harris’s team and top Biden aides took specific steps to right the ship — but only after what some White House officials now admit was a poor job of supporting the vice president at the outset. Tonight, she will step before a packed, enthusiastic crowd to accept the Democratic presidential nomination.</description>

      <description>Vice President Kamala Harris and other party leaders have avoided the issue in recent stump speeches, including keynote remarks at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this week. The reasons are complex, but leaders may fear alienating key constituencies.</description>

Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he would be willing to bypass the filibuster to get the bills passed. Democrats would need to keep the Senate and flip the House in the November election.</description>
