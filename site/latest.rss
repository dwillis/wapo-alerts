      <title>Trump’s N.Y. hush money trial to start April 15, judge says, rejecting defense motion to sanction prosecutors</title>
      <description>Lawyers for former president Donald Trump had asked to delay his New York criminal trial at least until June and to sanction prosecutors over the last-minute revelation of potential evidence about Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and fixer and a key witness. Trump is accused of falsifying business records to cover up his reimbursement to Cohen of a hush money payment during the 2016 election.</description>

      <title>U.N. Security Council passes its first resolution calling for a Gaza cease-fire after four failed attempts. The U.S. abstained.</title>
      <description>The resolution, backed by 14 nations including Russia and China, demands an immediate cease-fire during the month of Ramadan and the release of all hostages. Four previous cease-fire resolutions had failed, including one proposed by the United States on Friday. The American abstention is likely to further strain U.S. relations with Israel amid sharp disagreements over Israel’s planned military offensive in Rafah.</description>

      <title>Companies are vying to bring back supersonic air travel. Here’s what to know about their efforts — and the likelihood of success.</title>
      <description>There hasn’t been a commercial supersonic passenger jet since the Concorde stopped flying in 2003. Since then, supersonic jets have been used primarily by the military. Now NASA and a growing number of private companies are promising to bring back a form of modern supersonic travel that will be quieter, greener and more affordable than in the past. But there are questions about whether they can make good on their claims, given the economics of air travel and growing concerns about the impact of commercial aviation on the environment.</description>

      <title>Women are dropping birth control amid a misinformation explosion driven by social media influencers and conservative commentators</title>
      <description>Social media algorithms feed young women a stream of videos reinforcing messages divorced from scientific evidence. Instead, many social media influencers recommend “natural” alternatives, such as timing sex to menstrual cycles — a less effective birth-control method that doctors warn could result in unwanted pregnancies in a country where abortion is now banned or restricted in nearly half the states.</description>
