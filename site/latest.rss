      <title>What we know about the man suspected of causing California’s largest wildfire</title>
      <description>The man suspected of causing the wildfire is a loner with a criminal record. Authorities say a witness saw him light a vehicle on fire and push it down a ravine, triggering an explosive conflagration that led to his arrest.


Neighbors of Ronnie Stout, a 42-year-old Chico resident, say they never imagined he’d do anything like this — a mysterious act that put them at mortal risk.</description>

      <description>The Justice Department has agreed to settle claims by former senior FBI special agent Peter P. Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who had sued saying the government violated their privacy rights when it leaked their politically charged text messages criticizing Donald Trump.


Strzok's attorneys say he will receive a $1.2 million settlement. Terms for Page were not disclosed. Strzok and Page said they were illegally targeted for retribution by the Trump administration after the FBI investigated Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election.</description>

      <title>Companies producing millions of dollars of carbon offset credits in the Amazon routinely use public land they have no right to</title>
      <description>A six-month Washington Post investigation reveals that many carbon credit ventures have repeatedly and, authorities say, illegally laid claim to publicly protected lands, generating enormous profits and then failing to share the revenue with those who protected or lived on the land. The use of such lands to sell credits also contributes little to reducing carbon emissions, even though carbon credits are considered one of the world’s most important tools in the fight against climate change.</description>
