      <title>What we know about China’s alleged election interference in Canada as Trudeau testifies in public inquiry</title>
      <description>China sought to “clandestinely and deceptively” influence Canada’s federal elections in 2019 and 2021 with the aim of electing candidates that could further — or at least not oppose — Beijing’s strategic interests, according to Canadian intelligence reports introduced as evidence in a public inquiry.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had long resisted calls to launch a public inquiry into claims that China interfered in Canada’s elections and has defended his government’s response to the threat of foreign interference. The Canadian leader, who is testifying before the commission today, has said there’s no evidence the results of the elections were compromised.</description>

      <title>Which of Trump’s lies stick? Republicans believe some falsehoods more than they did six years ago, our poll finds.</title>
      <description>A Washington Post-Schar School Fact Checker poll finds that most Americans, including Republicans, do not believe many of Donald Trump’s most repeated claims. But he has made significant inroads in convincing Republicans that his lies are the truth. That applies to election integrity especially — the basis of Trump’s “big lie.”</description>

      <title>Lawmakers unveil sprawling proposal to expand U.S. privacy protections. Here’s what’s in it.</title>
      <description>Unveiled by two top lawmakers, the bipartisan bill would force companies to limit how much personal information they collect from consumers, a major breakthrough in the decades-long fight to pass online privacy protections. The measure, reviewed by The Washington Post, would set a national baseline for how a broad swath of companies can collect, use and transfer data on the internet. It also would give users the right to opt out of certain data practices, including targeted advertising. Despite Sunday’s announcement, the proposal faces uncertain prospects as no comprehensive privacy bill has ever cleared a chamber of Congress.</description>
